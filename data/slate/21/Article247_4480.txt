               Is Kevin MacDonald an anti-Semite with nauseating ideas or just a
misunderstood evolutionary psychologist? If he's an anti-Semite, should the
editor who published his scholarly work and the colleagues who welcomed him
into their professional association be held partly responsible for his
ideas?
            

            
               MacDonald, a professor of psychology at California State University at
Long Beach, is about to testify in London on behalf of David Irving, a
historian of World War II who is suing another historian over her charge that
he is a Holocaust revisionist. In "Evolutionary
Psychology's Anti-Semite," Culturebox gives a foretaste of MacDonald's
testimony, drawing from books in which he argues 1) that Judaism is a conscious
strategy of eugenicism designed to maximize Jewish intelligence, and 2) that
anti-Semitism is therefore justified. In "On Fighting
Bad Ideas," Culturebox argues that the association of evolutionary
psychologists, the Human Behavior and Evolution Society (HBES), of which
MacDonald is the secretary, archivist, newsletter editor, and executive board
member, should never have let him get as far as he has without refuting
him.
            

            
               MacDonald disagrees strongly with Culturebox, as do several evolutionary
psychologists who feel it is unfair of Culturebox to call them to account for
someone else's ideas. Click here to read
