            Chatterbox, ever alert for signs of when the next recession will come, tries
always to read the Wall Street Journal very closely. It is a superb
publication (full disclosure: Chatterbox used to work there). During the last
few days, however, Chatterbox has been a little pressed for time amid the
hurly-burly of domestic life (the refrigerator broke down, the Chattersitter
smashed up the Taurus wagon), and he's been looking for shortcuts. The best
one, of course, is to read 
                  Slate
               's "Today's Papers"
feature. But another technique is to count the number of sections the
Journal comes in. Lately, it's often come in four (front section;
international news and editorials and the politics-and-policy "back page";
marketplace section; and money and investing section) rather than the customary
three. In addition to making it more difficult to find the Journal 's
tendentious editorial page, more sections have the added benefit of
demonstrating that the business sector has more money to spend on Wall
Street Journal ads. When the four-section Journal s stop appearing
(or when Journal managing editor Paul Steiger changes his mind and
decides he wants to quit after all--according to press reports,
he said no late last week to becoming the new Lou Dobbs at CNNfn) you'll know
the economy is about to tank.

            Another sign might be the disappearance of ads like the one in the latest
issue of Talk that shows a gorgeous model pouring Evian water into a
goldfish bowl. Come to think of it, this ad may be a sign that a stock market
crash is imminent.
