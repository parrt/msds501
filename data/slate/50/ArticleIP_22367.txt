                        Monday in federal court, Itsy Bitsy lawyers told a
judge that Bubbly Chubbies must be destroyed.
Why?

Wrap-Up
               

            

            By rights, this story should have taken place in
Japan, the most cuteness-loving country on earth and, coincidentally, the most
pornography-laden nation on the planet and hence a popular destination for
vacationing animated space monsters. With perky breasts. And huge, adorable
eyes. Whose crazy adventures are recounted in comic books available in vending
machines on the platforms of every Tokyo train station. So what are we to make
of this Hello Kitty-porn juxtaposition?

            Betty Boop. That was the
American manifestation of a big-eyed, baby-talking erotic ideal, a sexual
fashion that's come and gone. (It is gone, right? Poppin' Fresh--he's a whole
other thing, right?) Perhaps in Japan the cute and the concupiscent do not
coincide but coexist as two distinct phenomena. Like here in the United States
with sex and the pizza. Still separate, right? Could I have that with
pepperoni?

Answer
            

            Bubbly Chubbies must be destroyed because they're a
knock-off of Teletubbies.

            The suspiciously cuddly and maybe just a little too
adorable dolls, on sale in Wal-Mart's 2,435 stores, threaten the
$800-million-a-year business generated by the originals. Even the name was
chosen "deliberately to rhyme with Teletubbies," charged lawyers for the Itsy
Bitsy Entertainment Company, the Teletubbies' owners.

            "The company would never
knowingly infringe anyone's copyright," said Wal-Mart spokesman Michael Maher.
"Can I offer you a drink--a Croaka-Cola, or maybe something stronger, like a
shot of Jack Spaniels?" he didn't add.
