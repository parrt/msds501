               Told
Mountain
            

            I am
furious! James Wood revealed the plot and ending of Cold 
               Mountain
in his review ("Gone With the Wind"). That's the last time I read a book review in

                  Slate
               , folks. From a review, I want an impression of the book and
an opinion, not all the details of the plot! If the author uses a plot with a
surprise ending, he probably wants the reader to be surprised. Wood should not
have done this; you should never have published his review. Can you change it
now before you reveal the plot to other innocent readers like me?

               Not
Innocent
            

            In
"Today's
Papers" for Dec. 24, Scott Shuger says the Washington Post made a
rookie mistake for saying that Terry Nichols was "innocent" of bombing charges
instead of "not guilty." Not so fast. The newspaper has a very good reason.
According to the Associated Press stylebook, the manual for how reporters and
editors should address varying concerns, one should "use innocent ,
rather than not guilty , in describing a defendant's plea or a jury
verdict, to guard against the word not being dropped inadvertently." Now
many other newspapers have their own styles, even when it comes to "innocent"
vs. "not guilty." But the technical difference is secondary to possible libel
concerns.
