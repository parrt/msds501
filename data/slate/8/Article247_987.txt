            Dear Andrew,

            Happy Monday to you. The paper's pretty boring today, isn't it? But it
strikes me that I have in you a tremendous resource: instead of wondering what
it is conservatives can possibly be thinking when they say or do something I
don't understand at all, I can ask you! So here is my question: Why do
conservatives hate President Clinton so much? Many observers have noted how far
to the right he is on many issues--he loves corporate capitalism (NAFTA, for
example); his judicial appointments have been very centrist; he favors the
death penalty, the anti-drug war, balanced budgets, welfare reform and many
other causes dear to the right. It's true he's not a homophobe like so many
right-wingers, but it's not as though he's actually done anything for gays
(except, as you've noted, get more of them than ever kicked out of the armed
forces). Ditto on minorities--he's not opposed to affirmative action, but he
expended no political capital defending it--as in fighting California's Prop.
209. Women he's done a bit more for--but even there, more for show than in
reality.

            For a person of materialist turn of mind, like me, it is hard to understand
the vitriolic hatred of Clinton on the American
Spectator -Scaife-Rutherford Institute side of the spectrum. And not just
there, either. Conservatives should love this man, who accomplishes so much of
their agenda while bewitching so many liberals! A Republican could never have
pushed through welfare reform, or the crime bill, without raising a major storm
of protest.

            Is it all really about sex, drugs and rock and roll, after all?

            Cheers,
Katha
