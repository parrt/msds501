        Madeiras hotels, many of them traditional, older style
        accommodations, have long have been clustered in the hotel and tourist
        zones hugging Funchals western coast. In recent years, many of those
        hotels have been urgently updating their design and services, as even
        more hotels are being built in the zona turista. At the same time, the
        hotel offerings across the island are rapidly being expanded, and
        visitors can now choose from hotels, quintas (villas), estalagens and
        pousadas (inns) along the coasts and in the villages and mountains of
        the interior.
        Book especially early for Christmas and New Years (when
        most hotels charge a huge supplement) and for smaller hotels throughout
        the year. Otherwise, high season rates generally apply February through
        May and late July to the end of September. Room price guidelines below
        are for a double room with bath in high season, including breakfast and
        VAT (value-added tax). All hotels accept major credit cards. For making
        reservations, Portugals country code is 351; the prefix for Madeira is
        291.
