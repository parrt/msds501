            The woman
Robinson writes about in this poem must choose between a disastrous love affair
and no love affair at all. She chooses the calamity. The material is like that
of much American country music--this is a cheatin' song, in its way, and also a
song about small-town life, the way gossip about an extraordinary person can
somehow elevate both the locale and that heroic figure. Story becomes myth in
that communal whispering, an effect Robinson imitates with his amazing rhymes,
a kind of hyper-ballad. It's worth noting that Robinson knew small-town life
and also suffering; he was destitute until President Theodore Roosevelt,
directed by one of the Roosevelt children to a book of Robinson's, created a
government job for the poet.

            
               --Robert Pinsky
            

            She fears
him, and will always ask          What fated her to choose him;She meets in his
engaging mask          All reasons to refuse him;But what she meets and what
she fearsAre less than are the downward yearsDrawn slowly to the foamless weirs
         Of age, were she to lose him.

            Between a
blurred sagacity          That once had power to sound him,And Love, that will
not let him be          The Judas that she found him,Her pride assuages her
almost,As if it were alone the cost.He sees that he will not be lost,         
And waits and looks around him.

            A sense
of ocean and old trees          Envelops and allures him;Tradition, touching
all he sees,          Beguiles and reassures him;And all her doubts of what he
saysAre dimmed with what she knows of days--Till even prejudice delays,        
 And fades, and she secures him.

            The
falling leaf inaugurates          The reign of her confusion;The pounding wave
reverberates          The dirge of her illusion;And home, where passion lived
and died,Becomes a place where she can hide,While all the town and harbor side 
        Vibrate with her seclusion.

            We tell
you, tapping on our brows,          The story as it should be,As if the story
of a house          Were told, or ever could be;We'll have no kindly veil
betweenHer visions and those we have seen,As if we guessed what hers have been,
         Or what they are or would be.

            Meanwhile
we do no harm; for they          That with a god have striven,Not hearing much
of what we say,          Take what the god has given;Though like waves breaking
it may be,Or like a changed familiar tree,Or like a stairway to the sea        
 Where down the blind are driven.
