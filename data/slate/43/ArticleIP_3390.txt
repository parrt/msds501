            I suppose
some readers will be surprised to find such a sexy, delicately doom-laden poem
by Robert Frost as "To Earthward." In fact, Frost is a powerfully erotic
writer, from early poems like "Mowing" and on through the disturbances of "The
Hill Wife." The sensuality of "To Earthward" is acted out by its reaching,
lingering, abrupt, or stretched sentences as they tease and cavort with rhyme
and line ending. The poem is the best lesson I know in what a line of verse is:
Read it aloud, letting your voice continue past the line ending, when that is
what the syntax wants to do.

            
               --Robert Pinsky
            

            Love at the lips was
touchAs sweet as I could bear;And once that seemed too much;I lived on air

            That crossed me from sweet
thingsThe flow of--was it muskFrom hidden grapevine springsDown hill at
dusk?

            I had the swirl and ache
From sprays of honeysuckleThat when they're gathered shakeDew on the
knuckle.

            I craved strong sweets,
but thoseSeemed strong when I was young;The petal of the roseIt was that
stung.

            Now no joy but lacks
saltThat is not dashed with painAnd weariness and fault;I crave the stain

            Of tears, the aftermarkOf
almost too much love, The sweet of bitter barkAnd burning clove.

            When stiff and sore and
scarredI take away my handFrom leaning on it hardIn grass and sand,

            The hurt is
not enough.I long for weight and strengthTo feel the earth as roughTo all my
length.
