            Last Saturday's New York Times profile of literary
critic/professional curmudgeon George Steiner characterized Steiner's career as
"a celebration of the virtues of being utterly out of fashion." (Steiner
modestly concurred: "I know an embarrassing lot. Terrible.") Once again, the
Times has spotted a trend. Although background research is out of
fashion these days, we boldly did a Nexis search. Hard to believe how many
people have been courageously bucking fashion in the past 30 days alone! Here
are just 55 out of the 214 things deemed "unfashionable" in the American,
British, and Australian press between March 21 and today:

a critic if he could be a writer?" (In a review of Steiner's book by Michael
Dirda of the Washington Post )

            By contrast, Renzo Piano, winner of this year's Pritzker Prize in
architecture, "likes to think of himself as unconventional " (italics
ours), according to The New Yorker . Culturebox has no doubt that he
does. After all, being unconventional is fashionable. Almost as fashionable as
being unfashionable.
