            I wore a black knit hatso
I could be undistinguished in the warand carried a small bagso I could be
mistaken for a doctor,

            and once in a whorehouse
while waiting for a friend of mine to finishI examined the madam on the kitchen
table; and I spent Sunday at either the Serbian Club

            or the post-war Literary
Club on Atwood Street above the pre-war clothing store, and ate hot sausage
sandwiches and cold buttermilk across the street from the first Carnegie
Library

            and made plans for the
next seventy years. I drove Andy Warhol to the East Liberty train station in my
father's 1949 Ford. Believe it or not I bought a 1949 Buick

            thirteen years later for
fifteen dollars and drove it into a junkyard six years after. My first
instrument was a kind of kazoo and that led naturally to a French trombone. I
was

            loyal to my own music for
fifty years though I detested snare drums and tap dancing, just as I do those
singers now who hold their left fists in the air while holding the
microphone

            inside their mouths. And I
hate short sleeved shirts when they wear them with dark neckties, skinny swine
knocking on closed doors; and I had a habit of counting bricks, a nice
obsession compared with

            washing hands or touching
car doors, it gave mefreedom with walls so I could handle bulging and sagging
when I had to; and one of the summers I read Steinbeck and made love--in the
bedroom--

            to my aunt's cleaning
woman in upstate Pennsylvania and learned to adore the small town with its rows
of stores and trees on the sidewalk and only a short walk into the country, in
this case up a steep hill,

            the dogs more sullen the
farther up you went, and Russian and Roman churches below, the sunlight on the
river, the bridge empty, the outer one half-hidden, I was shocked by the sudden
distance

            and I had a Brown's Beach
jacket with a reddish thorn in one of the pockets, which was my toothpick for
thirty-five years, and a vest to match, and a flattened acorn I kept in the
darkness; and I had a pencil

            I used to keep my balance,
the edges were eaten,the lead was grey, the green eraser was worn down to the
metal, and I had a spiral notebook I kept for emotions, and I folded my
money.
