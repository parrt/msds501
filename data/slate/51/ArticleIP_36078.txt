            As a liquor store owner, I'm not so concerned about
my fair state losing out on millions of tax dollars through Internet sales.
What does concern me greatly, however, is the fact that I pay $2,000 annually
to my local selectmen for the privilege of selling wines in my town. Why should
someone from across the country, having paid no licensing fees whatsoever, be
able to take potential business away from me? Granted, some locations are state
regulated, but for those of us who are privately operated, the idea of someone
being allowed to compete with us for free is insulting. I have no problem with
competition; just make sure that it's a level playing field.

            This whole unsavory episode brings back memories of
skits with Monty Python ! One of my favorite lines was, "You are guilty
of six--no, seven--charges of heresy. Of course, the limits of television
broadcasting prevent me from presenting a shred of evidence to support
them."

            If the behavior of the reporters was so
indefensible in your mind, why aren't they identified by name? Professional
courtesy?

            Nowhere does 
                  Slate
                prove
that the following definition (from the "Anti-Semitism" ) has anything to do
with the examples cited in Mr. Buchanan's book: "[Anti-Semitism] is an
ideology--an interlocked set of principles and prejudices--in which certain
nefarious traits or practices are ascribed to Jews as a people, even when few
Jews exhibit those traits or when other people engage in those practices."

            
               
                  Slate
                proceeds to name
very specific individuals, presumably Jews, whose policies Mr. Buchanan takes
to task. Where is the generalization to "Jews as a people"? Where does he
impugn that only Jews subscribe to such policies? Which of his examples involve
"traits or practices"? The examples simply do not support his premise that Mr.
Buchanan is prejudiced.

            The uproar by the liberals is understandable.
Catholic bashing is OK since it is, a priori , art. Doing the same
thing to, let's say, blacks or Jews, is hateful and mean-spirited ...

            I do not want my tax money to support trash art, or
any art for that matter. If I want to enjoy art, I go to the Met or MoMA in
NYC. I pay my admission for the privilege. We have no more business supporting
art precisely because one person's art is another person's trash.

            While the Madonna and dung are certainly (and
certainly intentionally) inflammatory, I think there's a bigger and older issue
still unresolved. Namely, that the art world thinks that the purpose of art is
to expand the boundaries of human perception and to confront our cultural
limitations while hoi polloi would be far more likely to define it as to render
beauty with skill.

            Until curators and critics manage to convince the
great unwashed that beauty and skill are irrelevant (or even antagonistic) to
art, we will have these contretemps every year or two.

"Intrusive" Literary Devices

            So a literary device fails if it is intrusive,
destroys the illusion of transparency and calls attention to itself as a
construct? Like the final scene of A Winter's Tale , or the last speech
of The Tempest ? This standard for literary achievement would also
discredit any work in the modernist tradition--for example Brecht's and
Beckett's plays. You might also have to dump a few classics on the order of
Paradise Lost or Tristram Shandy .

            It is only a very narrow and very recent tradition
in literature that demands we prop up the notion that art should resemble life
as closely as possible and in all its probabilities. This doctrine of
expressive realism is a nineteenth-century notion that most historically aware
writers have moved beyond. At least Morris isn't pretending, like most
traditional biographers, that he is in command of some untainted objectivity
beyond authorial presence or beyond fiction. The subjectivity of the author is
indelible--at least Morris has the guts to expose it.

            I thought Mr. Plotz's article was very funny. But I
think he is factually incorrect on the question of whether severe storms are
increasing. Across this hemisphere, according to the scientists at the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, severe storms--meaning more than 2
inches of rainfall in a 24-hour period--are up about 20 percent compared with
the century average. That's an enormous increase in a baseline physical
phenomenon; it's as if you woke up and everyone was suddenly seven feet tall.
It begs for explanation, and the most plausible explanation, according to the
climatologists, is global warming.

            Warm air holds more water than cold air. Hence, a
warmed environment (and we've seen the ten warmest years on record since 1980)
will see both more aridity (due to increased evaporation) and precipitation
(when those clouds finally let loose). This may make me a Greeniac, but I think
it actually makes me more like a physicist. If you add more heat energy to a
confined space--the atmosphere--that energy is going to express itself, and one
way it will do so is with increased rainfall and storminess.
