        The following hotels are listed alphabetically in three
        price categories, grouped according to regions within the Los Angeles
        area and Orange County. All hotels are of a high standard, with private
        bath, air-conditioning, television, and telephone; most have king- or
        queen-sized beds. Breakfast is not usually included at US hotels,
        except on executive floors and at some budget motels that offer morning
        coffee, orange juice, and doughnuts or muffins.
        To make direct reservations with a hotel, we have included
        addresses (all in California, abbreviated CA) and telephone/fax
        numbers. Check-out time is generally noon or 1pm, with check-in usually
        available from 2pm to 3pm. All hotels accept major credit cards.
        Rates vary greatly according to season and availability;
        many hotels offer special weekend packages, business rates, and
        promotions. Ask about such discounts when booking. We have used the
        following symbols to indicate room prices (two persons in a double
        room, per night):
        ❁❁❁$200 and up
        ❁❁$100–$200
        ❁under $100
