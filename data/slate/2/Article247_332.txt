            A cry has gone up for President Clinton to comment less obliquely on Juanita
Broaddrick's rape charges. Thus far, his only comment has been through his
lawyer, David Kendall: "Any allegation that the president assaulted Ms.
Broaddrick more than 20 years ago is absolutely false." Should the president
provide a little more in the way of explanation? Sure. Will he? Chatterbox
seriously doubts it. Given this harsh reality, how about a little textual
overanalysis of what the president's legal team offered up? Prospecting for
hidden meaning, Chatterbox fed the phrase "absolutely false" to his new
favorite Web site, Anagram Genius. Here are some of the more suggestive anagrams it
spat back:

            
                
            

            Anagram: Foul beastly sale.

            
               Possible meaning: "Mark our words, Broaddrick's bucking for a book
contract."

            
                
            

            Anagram: Safely able louts.

            
               Possible meaning: "Clinton's guilty, but you'll never nail him (or
us) for this."

            
                
            

            Anagram: Flatly abuse lose.

            
               Possible meaning: "Clinton had sex with her, but it wasn't rape."

            
                
            

            Angram: Foully steal base.

            
               Possible meaning: "He's guilty."

            
                
            

            Anagram: Yell usable fatso.

            Anagram: Loyal felt abuses.

these days?"

            
                
            

            Anagram: A lousy fate bells.

            Anagram: Beauty! so self all.

            
               Possible meaning: "The president is too narcissistic to remember what
happened."
