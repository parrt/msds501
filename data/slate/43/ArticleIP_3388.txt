Vanishing," click .

            Awful that, when Frank
O'Hara died,his close friends raced to stop his familyfrom taking his
unpublished manuscripts,so jimmied his apartment door, to findoblivion already
settling like a coiled flailon the dirty dishes, clothes, unopened mail.

            As they rummaged through
the pleated filesand squeezed new music from the notices,what did this say of
his allegiances;just how impermanent they were? A lifespent thinking in the
theaters, drinking inlike cherry soda with mind-numbing fizz

            America's slow vanishing,
whose pacewas doubled, not restrained, by celluloid.The summer nights on Fire
Island, proppedon hard liquor like driftwood in a scuttle;the winter nights in
violin-backed chairs(the slender tenors with their pompadours!)

            at charity events--it all
broke down,packed up and slipped away with the winched kickof a stage set
knocked down by ball-peen hammers.The tragedy was that his familyhad final
right to claim him in the endand not the dry-eyed poets in the pews;

            who never tried to see
their world in hisor how he'd bled the neon of its light.Just as he frightened
the dolorous traditionand scatted new echoes from the mossy wells,we still fall
short of his ideal republicwhere we won't have to buy appliances.

            Set sail on that ocean
liner, sheeras a glacier, with moonlight churning below,and in the ballroom
take your tall seat at the bar--as the ship glides from the confetti docka
generation dons its clothes, then vanishes,and, staring at the hard dew on your
glass,

            you intuit the eons that
glitter and passto each side of the glacier as it movesand lift your eyes--    
                           the only passenger,you watch as the ballroom dopples
and becomesthe inside of the glacier, flawed, but bright; ora brick wall under
a fire escape, at night; or

            the moon
held in the curved arms of a bridge.
