            To hear the poet read "The
Naked Eye," click or on the title.

            The small stage he's
sitting snug against is radiantas an operating table on which the naked
dancerdoubled in the mirrored backdrop dances before himsimultaneously from
both sides at once, blond crotchAnd jiggling ass, nipple and churning
shoulderblade.

            If he's aware of us at
all, my friends and I,in a back booth farthest from the stage, what are webut
the proverbial rubes, sight-seeing frat boyson a sleazy lark, too loud, too
talkative, gigglinguneasy ironies about being where we'd never go alone.

            If we annoy him, the
annoyance must be somehow necessary to his pleasure, the rising of it
sweeterfor the last tug of a defeated gravity--as feeblenow, as faraway, as
being anybody's son or father.For he seems all gaze, nudging a dollar toward
her.

            And she, her back to him,
seems only what she shows as she bends over, reaching between her splayed
legsto pick it up, her face a moment upside down beneath her crotch, her pink
tongue flickering levelwith the face she watches watching her, the face
void

            of expression, dense as
stone, clinical as light,unmoved, as if the fantasy is that there isn't
one,that she isn't dancing any gesture of what sheimagines he imagines she
would feel like if hewere doing to her what she pretends he does.

            The fantasy is wholly of
the eye. The eye is his.The eye is lordly. Only imagine it as thinking: Let
the frat boys hoard how her fingertips have eased the hidden lips back to the
moist interior, let themsmuggle home to other women pale simulations
            

            
               of themselves still
outside watching what they onlyenter in the dark, what in the dark they only
feel --Only imagine it, and it is yours, your eye, and mine,no less
imperiously moving over him as his movesover the places in her she has never
seen.

            It is a seer's eye moving
lordly through the bar,over all of us its rapture cool, so otherworldly,who
here can deny that hidden craving is abroad,and that the cure lies in the body
spread before usthat the eye alone is shrewd enough to read.
