            By the last few times we
saw her it was clearThat things were different. When you tried to help herGet
out of the car or get from the car to the doorOr across the apartment house
hall to the elevatorThere was a new sense of heavinessOr of inertia in the
body. It wasn'tThat she was less willing to be helped to walkBut that the
walking itself had become less willing.Maybe the stupid demogorgon
blindRecalcitrance of body, resentful of the lawsOf mind and spirit, was
getting its own back now,Or maybe a new and subtle, alien,Intelligence of body
was obedient nowTo other laws: "Weight is the measure of The force with which a
body is drawn downward To the center of the earth"; "Inertia isThe tendency of
a body to resist Proceeding to its fate in any wayOther than that determined
for itself."

            That evening, at the
Bromells' apartment, after She had been carried up through the rational
structureBy articulate stages, floor after flashing floor,And after we helped
her get across the hall,And get across the room to a chair, somehowWe got her
seated in a chair that was placedA little too far away from the nearest
table,At the edge of the abyss, and there she sat,Exposed, her body the object
of our attention--The heaviness of it, the helpless graceless leg,The thick
stocking, the leg brace, the medical shoe.

            At work between herself
and us there wasA new principle of social awkwardnessAnd skillfulness required
of each of us.Our tones of voice in this easy conversationWere instruments of
marvelous finesse,Measuring and maintaining with exactitude"The fact or
condition of the differenceThere was between us, both in space and time."Her
smiling made her look as if she hadJust then tasted something delicious, the
charmHer courtesy attributed to her friends.

            This decent elegant fellow
human beingWas seated in virtue, character, disability,Behind her the order of
the ranged bookshelves,The windows monitored by Venetian blinds--"These can be
raised or lowered; numerous slats,Horizontally arranged, and parallel,Which can
be tilted so as to admitPrecisely the desired light or air."

            We were all
her friends, Maggie, and Bill, and Anne,And I, and the nice Boston Brahmin
elderly manNamed Duncan, utterly friendly and benign.And of course it wasn't
whether or not the worldWas benign but whether it looked at her too much.She
wasn't 'painfully shy' but just the same I wouldn't be surprised if there had
beenPainfulness in her shyness earlier on,Say at dancing school. Like others,
though, she hadSurvived her childhood somehow. Nor do I meanShe was unhappy.
Maybe more or less soBefore her marriage. One had the sense of tripsArranged,
committees, concerts, baffled courage

            Living it through, giving
it order and style.And one had the sense of the late marriage as ofTwo
bafflements inventing the sense they made Together. The marriage seemed, to the
outside world,And probably was, radiant and triumphant,And I think that one
could almost certainly sayThat during the last, heroic, phase of things,After
his death, and after the stroke, she hadBy force of character and careful
management,Maintained a certain degree of happiness.

            The books there on the
bookshelves told their stories,Line after line, all of them evenly spaced,And
spaces between the words. You could fall through the spaces.In one of the books
Dr. Johnson told the story:"In the scale of being, wherever it begins,Or ends,
there are chasms infinitely deep;Infinite vacuities ... For surely,Nothing can
so disturb the passions, or Perplex the intellects of man so much,As the
disruption of this union withVisible nature, separation from allThat has
delighted or engaged him, a changeNot only of the place but of the mannerOf his
being, an entrance into a state Not simply which he knows not, but perhapsA
state he has not faculties to know."

            The dinner was delicious,
fresh greens, and reds,And yellows, produce of the season due,And fish from the
nearby sea; and there were alsoAshes to be eaten, and dirt to drink.
