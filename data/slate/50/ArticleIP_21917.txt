            Their father was a hunting man.

            Each spring the Easter rabbit sprung open

            above the bathroom sink, drip slowed

            by the split pink pods of its ears

            to an intravenous trickle.

            There was the occasional deer,

            though he had no particular taste

            for venison--too stringy, he said,

            but made mother smoke it up just in case,

            all four haunches and the
ribs.

            Summer always ended with a catfish

            large as a grown man's thigh

            severed at the hip, thrashing

            in a tin washtub: a mean fish, a fish

            who knew the world was to be endured

            between mud and the
shining hook.

            He avoided easy quarry: possum

            and squirrel, complacent carp.

            He wouldn't be caught dead

            bagging coon; coon, he said,

            was fickle meat--tasted like

            chicken one night, the next like

            poor man's lobster. He'd never admit

            being reduced to eating coon,

            to be called out of his name

            and into that
cartoon.

            It's not surprising they could eat the mess

            he made of their playground: They watched

            the October hog gutted with grim fury,

            a kind of love gone wrong, but oh

            they adored each whiskery hock, each

            ham slice brushed
subterranean green.

            They were eating his misery

            like bad medicine meant to help them

            grow. They would have done anything

            not to see his hand jerk like that,

            his belt hissing through the loops and

            around that fist working inside the coils

            like an animal gnawing, an animal

            who knows freedom's worth anything

            you need to leave behind to get to it--

            even your own flesh and blood.
