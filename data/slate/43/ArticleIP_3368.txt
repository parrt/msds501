            Inventing a holy land,who
would have settled for theseneutral hills bare except for scrub and sage,a sky
unclouded as impenetrable,now and then the timeless Bedouin tent--which would
explain, along that ridge,a straggling flock of goatswith stretched-out,
walking shadows?

            And now the eastern
approaches. Yet nothingabout the frontier's fenced compoundssuggests the
traveller en route elsewhereshould stop--even if stepping on the gascan't do
much toward cancelling those pictures,the color of pain, a visual undersong
...Once coppergreen expanses of waterslide into view, though, no one could
failto sense the difference in beingbelow sea level--air heavyin the ear,
oxygen-rich, cool, dry,scented with desert, and holy enough.A hand dipped in
water pondersthe viscous feel of minerals in solution,and little tumuli of
salts and carbonatesbuild a submarine city sprawlingfor miles under the
hammered-metal surface.On a shore hazed with distance, neat rowsof date palms
identify themselveswith a green herringbone frond and ripen foodstuffs for,
say, the heavenly banquet.Ritual ablution even so has coatedyour skin with a
pale silt glove;and sea and desert are one.

            Remember the hands,
calloused and sunburned,of the Quumran scribes, seated at a cave's
mouth,negotiating light that dawn brought backwith the promise of
deliverance.Shadow and light, black fireon white fire, the unswerving
word,conferring a sacred indifferenceto an urban, merely visual appeal.The
caves, dark sockets in a cliff wall,return no one's gaze today,even if they
once did seea mountain range of crumpled felt,castiron eagles fixed on
approaching spears,and a southbound Jordan feeding the samefluid body, ever
moremineral, ever heavier with salt.
