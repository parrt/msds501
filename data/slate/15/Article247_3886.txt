            Pat
Buchanan's Holocaust revisionism has never taken the form of his denying
that Nazis murdered some Jews. Rather, he has consistently hinted,
indicated, and implied that that he thinks the Nazis were somewhat less guilty
of the Holocaust than people make them out to be. Today on ABC's Good
Morning America , Buchanan tried shifting the blame for the Holocaust away
from the Nazis once again. Asked by Diane Sawyer about Donald Trump's comment
that he was a "Hitler-lover," the newest candidate for the Reform Party
nomination had this to say:

            

               Well let me explain. In the book I wrote, I referred to Hitler as a monster.
I say that he--he behaved like Al Capone in his first days in office and he and
Stalin let loose their SS and NKVD killers and set up Auschwitz and perpetuated
the massacre.

            

            The Russian NKVD was the 1930s ancestor of the KGB. It helped Stalin to kill
many millions in its day. The Jews of Auschwitz, however, were not among them.
To be more specific: Russian NKVD killers did not help to "set up Auschwitz."
Nor did they "perpetuate the massacre" there. Auschwitz didn't even begin
operating as a death camp until 1942, long after Hitler ended his
non-aggression pact with Stalin by invading the Soviet Union.

            Claiming that Hitler and the Nazis weren't solely responsible for Auschwitz
may be the single most extraordinary and outrageous thing Buchanan has ever
said about the Holocaust. It isn't anyone's eccentric or revisionist view of
history. It's the fantasy of a disturbed person who thinks he can get elected
president with the support of the Teamsters, David Duke, and Lenora Fulani.

            Yesterday the Republican Party ... today his faculties.
