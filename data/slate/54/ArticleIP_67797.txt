                will be publishing
erratically for the next couple of weeks. There seems to be some holiday going
on. The normal flood of magnificent journalism gushing from this URL will be
reduced to a trickle, and you may want to seize this opportunity to catch up on
your 
                  Slate
                reading from the past year. The "
                  Slate
               
Archives" (formerly known as the "Compost") is now accessible without charge,
and you can use 
                  
                     Slate
                   Search to produce a
list of articles in any department or by any author. (Of course you also can do
a normal search for occurrences of particular words.)

            We thought of providing a list of articles worth a
second look (or, for our many new readers in 1999, a first look). But, on
reflection, we didn't want to spend the holiday break pacifying outraged
authors who were left out. So we suggest that you poke around at random. Start,
if you wish, with our pre-selected list of random words beginning with the
letter M:

            Monica

            Millennium

            Merger

            Microsoft

            McCain

            Money

            Or pick your own word, type it in the search window
at the bottom of this page along with "1999," and see what you get. Or go to
our search page and ask for all articles published on your
birthday. Frankly, you cannot go very wrong.

            Merry Christmas from all of us at

                  Slate
               . And have a nice millennium.
