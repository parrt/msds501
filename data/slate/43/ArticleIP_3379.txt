            In our contemporary
discourse, literacy and culture sometimes tend to be associated with the visual
act of reading: What comes in through the ear, that organ of the Walkman, may
be considered less reflective or intellectual. For Ben Jonson, writing this
brilliant poem early in the 17 th century, the opposite is true: The
ear is the avenue of the spirit, while the eye is duped by mere seeming. What
he means about the ear he demonstrates in sentences that skim and dance across
the lines and rhymes, flamenco-style, or like Michael Jordan creating space
where there was none.

            
               --Robert
Pinsky
            

             

            I now think
love is rather deaf, than blind,

            For else it could not
be,

                      That she,

            Whom I
adore so much, should so slight me,

            And cast my love behind:

            I'm sure my
language to her was as sweet,

                  And every close did
meet

                In sentence of as subtle
feet

                      As hath the
youngest he,

            That sits in shadow of
Apollo's tree.

            Oh, but my
conscious fears,

                That
fly my thoughts between,

                Tell me that she hath
seen

            My hundreds of gray
hairs,

            Told seven and forty
years,

            Read so much waist, as she
cannot embrace

            My mountain belly and my
rocky face,

            And all
these, through her eyes, have stopt her ears.
