        By the year 2000, there were roughly 130,000 rooms in Las
        Vegas. This makes selecting a hotel room intimidating, but not
        impossible. One must consider the usual factors — cost, location, and
        budget — as well as how integral you want your hotel to be to your
        visit. It is possible, though not advisable, to visit Las Vegas and
        never leave your hotel premises.
        The following is a recommended selection of Las Vegass best
        hotels in four price categories. For a comprehensive listing of
        available hotels and motels, call the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors
        Authority (see Accommodations on page 109).
        All businesses must comply with the Americans with
        Disabilities Act, and are therefore wheelchair accessible. Newer
        properties are the easiest to navigate, older and Downtown properties
        slightly more difficult.
        All hotels in Las Vegas accept all major credit cards (Visa,
        Mastercard, American Express). Price ranges listed do not include
        suites. Expect holiday and weekend rates to be significantly higher,
        and be sure to ask for specific quotes for your intended stay. For more
        information about most of these hotels, particularly with regard to
        their casinos and attractions, look in Where To Go starting on page
        26.
