               BORED AND CONFUSED BY THE ISSUES IN THIS TIME OF PROSPERITY AND
WIDESPREAD POLITICAL APATHY???
            

            YOU'RE NOT ALONE!!!

            If you're like Chatterbox , you have little time during this
busy holiday season to sort out what positions the Democratic
presidential candidates should take. Fortunately, there's an easy
solution! 
               Just observe whatever Bill Bradley accuses Al
Gore of secretly favoring , or whatever Al Gore accuses
Bill Bradley of secretly favoring !
            

            
               THAT WILL BE WHAT WISE GOVERNANCE DICTATES! IT'S THAT SIMPLE!!!
            

            In most presidential elections , you get lots of
ideologically different candidates vying for the Democratic

               nomination . This can be very confusing . In this election,
you get two candidates who are ideological twins! For all their
populist posturing, 
                  both candidates are "third way" Democrats
(formerly known as "neoliberals") who can be counted on to favor a
non-doctrinaire, moderately liberal style of governing.
FUNDAMENTALLY, IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHICH ONE GETS THE
NOMINATION!!!
            

            Deep down, Bradley and Gore both know they are
interchangeable, and find it deeply unsettling. So they lash out
at one another by each accusing the other of favoring politically
unpopular, but programmatically wise policy positions: to raise
taxes if circumstances warrant it; to raise the retirement age for
Social Security benefits; to consider school vouchers on an experimental
basis; and so on. EACH ONE OF THESE IS A POLICY WELL WORTH
CONSIDERING!!!
            

            Next time you see Gore and Bradley debate, try Chatterbox's unique
method for determining the right positions on the issues: look to
see what each accuses the other of secretly wanting! Then say, "Hey, sue
me, I want that, too!" YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!!
