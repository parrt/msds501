        Hong Kong has some of the most luxurious hotels in the
        world, with representatives from all the major international chains.
        Hotels listed below have full air-conditioning, offer 24-hour or
        limited room service, and a wide range of facilities. Hong Kong hotels
        have excellent business services and conference facilities; many have
        shopping malls.
        Reservations are strongly recommended, particularly in
        summer and at Christmas. If you do arrive without making advance
        arrangements, the Hong Kong Hotel Reservation Center at the
        International Airport will be happy to arrange accommodations for you
        on your arrival.

        occupancy, with bath or shower. Unless otherwise noted, hotels take all
