            After the issues raised
first by the dawnHad been considered for a while and (darnIt!) lost their
appeal, some agent of the darkStabbed at the afternoon as if with a dirkThe
disappearance of the sun's red diskIn a sea of golden dust brought us to
dusk

            An unseen term, after the
after-birth,Emerges: We're delivered of our dearth,As when today you rose from
bed, warm hearth,Promising kettle, desire's best of health:In the gray distance
over a bare heathYou discerned, striding toward you, someone's death.

            One hears such stories
with one's eyes unwet:She woke up one day and found that the TetOffensive had
left her widowed with a totWho broke her heart as if it were a toy.Luck having
given her one so-so try,Wrung out her life and left her bones to dry.

            How many other questions
hide in "how?"Writers should make a deep, unwitting vowNever to think about
such questions. (Wow!I wish I could!) Rather than try to wooAnswers into the
mind's arms, dream of Who,Where, What they were wearing then, and Why.

            She took him to her place
at half-past oneHer bedroom windows bordered by caca d'oie Chintz
draperies--not nice--but lust says fieTo nice, for which it does not give a
fig.He'd gone there Thursday, just for a quick fixAnd didn't get back home till
after six.

            Wisdom's long weary
journey from the eastCeased when it halted once to take its easeIn some oasis
with a book, a vaseOf flowers, a cup of wine, love in a valeOf silken-covered
sand, no weathervaneClattering, ostentatious, giving ventTo windy thoughts, yet
knowing where it wentThe overgoing of the sad, late west.

            He
misdirected us, and so we came By a long route, which took us through a
caveFilled with the lapping of a distant wave.Our confidence already on the
waneWe wandered, wondering, ever more in wantOf knowing where the true way
really went.
