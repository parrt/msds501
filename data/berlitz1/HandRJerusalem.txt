        Always reserve a room before arriving in Jerusalem,
        especially during all major Jewish and Christian holidays. The regular
        season lasts from 1 March to 15 November, with the exception of holiday
        periods; the low season excludes Hanukkah/Christmas. Reduced rates are
        available at many hotels through tour operators that specialize in
        Israel or through airlines as part of land-package arrangements. The
        accommodations desk at Ben-Gurion airport can help you find a hotel
        room if youve arrived without a reservation.
        In West Jerusalem hotels, the room price usually includes a
        substantial Israeli breakfast; in East Jerusalem, the price usually
        includes at least a Continental breakfast. Most West Jerusalem hotels
        (with the exception of Christian hospices and guest houses) provide
        only kosher food services. Hotels in East Jerusalem do not offer kosher
        facilities.
        Hotel rates in Israel are always quoted in US dollars. The
