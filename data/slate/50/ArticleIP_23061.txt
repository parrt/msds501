            William Cowper, an 18 th -century
Protestant, may be best known for tormented, eloquent poems of religious fervor
and despair. Apparently, he was convinced that he was already damned to
hell.

            This poem about his not
very nice but beloved pet rabbit, Tiney, is funny and charming, but those
qualities do not divorce the poem from Cowper's intense melancholy and dread.
The poem is about death and comfort, and it demonstrates the genuineness of its
humility by its careful attention to details. The straightforwardness and
smiling directness are sad, temperate, heartfelt, and moving, as well as
droll.

            Here lies,
whom hound did ne'er pursue,

            Nor swifter greyhound
follow,
Whose foot ne'er tainted, morning dew,

            Nor ear heard huntsman's
hallo',

Old Tiney, surliest of his kind,

            Who, nursed with tender
care,
And to domestic bounds confined,

            Was still a wild
jack-hare.

Though duly from my hand he took

            His pittance every
night,
He did it with a jealous look,

            And, when he could, would
bite.

His diet was of wheaten bread,

            And milk, and oats, and
straw,
Thistles, or lettuces instead,

            With sand to scour his
maw.

On twigs of hawthorn he regaled,

            On pippins' russet
peel;
And when his juicy salads failed,

            Sliced carrot pleased him
well.

Turkey carpet was his lawn,

            Whereon he loved to
bound,
To skip and gambol like a fawn,

            And swing his rump
around.

His frisking was at evening hours,

            'For then he lost his
fear;
But most before approaching showers,

            Or when a storm drew
near.

Eight years and five round-rolling moons

            He thus saw steal
away,
Dozing out all his idle noons,

            And every night at
play,

I kept him for his humor's sake,

            For he would oft
beguile,
My heart of thoughts that made it ache,

            And force me to a
smile.

But now, beneath this walnut-shade

            He finds his long, last
home,
And waits in snug concealment laid,

            Till gentler Puss shall
come,

He, still more aged, feels the shocks

            From which no care can
save,
And, partner once of Tiney's box,

            Must soon partake his
grave.
