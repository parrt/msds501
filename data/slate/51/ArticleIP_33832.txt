Question(No 296)--"Lies! Damnable Lies!":
            

            

               "It is simply untrue," an ABC spokesperson testily announced Monday.
What is?

one."-- Barbara Lippert

            What's on ABC, folks?
Judging by today's responses, the network's lineup would seem to consist of
Peter Jennings, Sam Donaldson, Ted Koppel, and Barbara Walters, grilling Ellen
DeGeneres about her lesbianism while a bare-assed Regis Philbin dispenses cash
and prizes. But there are so many other fine programs on ABC to mock. There is,
for instance, the increasingly annoying Sports Night , a sitcom that
combines the most irritating aspects of David Mamet and thirtysomething .
Forthwith, the ABC spokesperson's remarks, as scripted by Sports Night
contributor Aaron Sorkin:

            "It is simply untrue."

            "Untrue?

            "Yes, untrue."

            "Untrue in that none of it's true, or that some of
it's true?"

            "Untrue untrue."

            "Yes, but what I'm saying, what I'm asking, is
whether any of it's true."

            "No."

            "No?"

            "No."

            "Date rape is bad."

            "Yes."

Answer
            

            The rumor that ABC was
heatedly denying was that Jamie Tarses, the president of ABC's entertainment
division and New York Times Magazine cover subject, would be leaving the
network. In an entirely unrelated development, ABC and parent company Disney
have come under fire for a promotion run by their KLOS-FM radio station, in
which morning disc jockeys Mark and Brian offered dark gardening implements to
callers. The implements were referred to as "Black Hoes." (I don't have a joke
here; I just wanted to give it more publicity.)

            On Monday, readers were
asked to try and find a headline even less enticing than the following, from
Monday's Daily Variety : "Dutch regulators issue equal-access
guidelines." Forthwith, the results:

            "Schools chief targets
pupil achievement"

            
               Chicago Tribune,

Thomas
            

            "Here's one from the
New York Press that makes my eyes glaze over, though maybe for a
different reason than 'Dutch regulators ...': 'Who's Killing the Hamptons?' I
guess the New York Press 
               is an alternative paper after all."

            -- Francis

            "Two Turkish Jews killed
in quake"

            (This may not be the least
enticing headline of the day, but it is certainly the most parochial.)

competing Quiz, ensuring that Randy will never speak to me again.
