            Judging by your responses,
here's what we know about the English--bad sex, bad food, bad teeth, bad
weather. Their insatiable appetite for royal gossip is cheerfully fed by a
venal press. Their factories manufacture a steady supply of ephemeral pop
groups. And they don't think much of the French and their bountiful supply of
good sex, good food, good weather, and--well, three out of four.

            This sort of jingoism is
unworthy of "News Quiz" players, who might charitably have pointed out how
graciously the English have transformed themselves from a ruthless imperial
power into a vast island museum that still believes itself to be a ruthless
imperial power. Self-delusion in others can be so endearing.

            And I'm
sure you all join me in wishing Kate Moss a speedy return to her health, and
Margaret Thatcher to her senses.

            Before getting married.

            The
government introduced a package of measures to support families--by thwarting
"quickie" weddings, making prenuptial agreements legally binding, and improving
mediation services. The Conservative Party denounced this "unprecedented level
of intrusion into family life."
