is both howmuch of a thing there is and how much it can do. From a
solidmagnetized and very hot core, the earth

            suffers itself to be
turned outside.Closest to its heart are the deepest submarinetrenches and
sinks. Its lava finds

            clefts there in the old
uplifted crust,the ocean floor a scramble. Wrapping at depth huge

            shield volcanoes, the
North Atlantic

            down- and upwells, its
denser layers makingroom behind them through the blue-green shortest
wavelengths of light. Inside the cubicyards it levies, league by league,
respiring,budgeting its heat, it hides

            its samenesses of
composition through and through.For the normal water level, an ideal

            solitary wave is surplus.
Any wave's speed is what it isonly if reversing it would render it still.

            Surfaces are almost
without featureat Sea Disturbance number one.When the wind stretches them,
their wrinkling gives itmore to hold onto. Three is

            multiplying
whitecaps.Spray blows in well-marked streaks at six.In the foam-spewed rolling
swell that takes a higher number, small and medium ships may be lost to view
for a long time.

            Waves are additive.
