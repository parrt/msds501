            Good Morning Andrew,

            In this morning's New York Times headlines, ''Astronomers Say a Disk
of Dust Holds a Clue to Birth of Planets.'' Three years ago, scientists learned
that other suns also have planets. Now they think they are actually able to
understand how planets are formed from stellar debris. According to the paper,
it's looking more and more likely that there is life on other planets.

            Are you with me in adding outer space to our list of boring subjects? Last
year I wrote a column in The Nation confessing that I didn't care what
kind of rocks Mars had and neither did anyone else I knew. Wrong again-it
turned out almost everyone I knew found this sort of information utterly
fascinating, and many of them wrote in to say so.

            Now, archeology, on the other hand-there's a science. Today's New York
Times obituary page carries an article about Linda Schele (only 55, very
sad), who as a young studio art teacher paid a visit to Mexico for Christmas in
l970 and fell in love with the Mayan ruins. By l973 she knew so much, that in
three hours working with an undergraduate, she was able to decipher Mayan
inscriptions that had baffled scholars for decades. It turns out that the
Mayans were not, as previously thought, a nation of dreamy stargazers but (the
old story!) violent enthusiasts of war, torture, human sacrifice and painful
blood-letting rituals, ''whose king was required to stick a rod through the
shaft of his own penis on ceremonial occasions.'' Sounds like Performance Art
Night at the Mineshaft.

            Cheers,
Katha
