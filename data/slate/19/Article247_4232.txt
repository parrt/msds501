            Chatterbox, who rarely disagrees with his 
                  Slate
                colleague Jacob Weisberg, a k a
"Ballot Box," must dissent from Weisberg's
view that Bill Bradley made Al Gore look like a jerk today on Meet the Press . As Weisberg rightly
points out, the key moment was when Gore proposed to Bradley that they both
agree to stop all television and radio advertising until the nomination is
decided, and instead debate twice a week for the duration of the campaign.
"That can get a lot of the money out of the presidential campaign and
accomplish one of the best reforms," Gore said. "What about it?" Bradley's
contemptuous response was to tell Gore, "Sounds to me like you're having
trouble raising money," and to call Gore's proposal a "ploy." In Weisberg's
view, Bradley succeeded in making Gore "look like a complete ass."

            But to Chatterbox's mind, it was Bradley who looked like the ass--or, to be
more specific, the hypocrite. As Weisberg has rightly pointed
out, Bradley's grandiose plan for campaign reform, which requires a
constitutional amendment, and which he trumpeted this week at a joint
appearance with John McCain, is far less practical than McCain's
campaign-reform plan. It is also less practical than Gore's. Bradley portrays
himself as a candidate who sees campaign reform as a far more urgent issue than
Gore does. But when Gore proposes doing something about the problem right now , Bradley mocks it as a stunt.
Bradley can't have it both ways. If the political process is as corrupted by
cash as he says, then he can't refuse an offer like Gore's out of hand without
looking like a phony. The fact that Gore's motive was to make Bradley look like a phony
didn't make it any less wrong for Bradley to mock and reject Gore's offer. Even
if it was a bluff, Bradley ought to have called it.
