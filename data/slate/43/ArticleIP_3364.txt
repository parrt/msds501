            To hear
the poet read "Dream Pun," click or on the title.

            I don't know how I knewthe
signalman was the signalman.His fuzzy red-brown hair the color of blood? I
knewhe wasn't just a waiter carrying a traywhen he pushed through the
rathskellerdoing the Hitler salute--not straight upSieg Heil but the lateral
one,elbow-fulcrum on his shoulder's plane,hand (made into blade) starting at
his heartsweeping the quadrant in front of himas if only to clear a paththrough
the jolly, blocked aisle.

            You weren't the woman at the
tall tableI was sitting with,where we eat together most of the timewatching the
sky change at sunset and talking about our day(characters from each other's
livesflickering ghostlike through that gorgeous air)--nor was I speaking to her
when he pushed through doing the Hitler salutethat meant run right then to save
myself.There wasn't time for a word to her.The bomb exploded as I got out the
door.

            You know what it was like in
there.You've listened to me so many hoursdepicting aftermaths of my blunt
shame.The place had been jammed, everyone drunk,the cellar had kept the
explosion in--pillowed, muffled, a brief hot thudwithin thick earth-sunk
concrete walls.But oh my God what it had done.I crawled back into the
rubblesearching for her, until I sawthe work I had to do now.What had happened
had happened,I'd never know how. I had to help withthe wounded and haul out the
dead.
