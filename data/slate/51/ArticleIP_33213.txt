            "The
good lambs
in the yellow barn--the rest
housed in blue." By

            "the
rest," meaning those who
--the guide explained--inevitably
arrive suffering. "For

            some
do," he added.
Soft.
Serious. This--like

            a new
lesson. As to
some among us, it was,
it seemed. The usual

            
stammer of heart the naive
tend to, in the face of what finally
is only the world. What

            must
it be, to pass
thus--clean, stripped--
through a life? What

            
reluctance the mind
shows on recognizing
that what it approaches

            is, at
last, the answer
to the very question it knows
now, but

            too
late,
oh better to never to have never
put forward. What I

            mean
is we moved
closer,
in,

            to the
blue barn's
advertisement--
flaw,

            
weakness. We
looked in.
Three days, four days

            old.
Few expected to
finish the evening it was beginning to
be already. And the small

            crowd
of us
shifting forward, and--
in our shifting uniformly--it

            being
possible to see how between
us and any
field rendered by a sudden wind

            single
gesture--kowtow,
upheaval--there was
little difference. Some

            took
photographs; most
did a stranger thing: touched
briefly, without

            
distinction, whichever
person stood immediately in
front of, next to. Less

            for
support than
as remedy or proof or
maybe--given the lambs who

            
besides dying, were as well
filthy (disease,
waste and, negotiating

            the
dwindling contract
between the two,
the flies everywhere)--

            maybe
the touching
concerned curbing the hand's instinct
to follow the eye, to

            confirm vision. Who
can
say? I was there--yes--but
I myself touched no one.
