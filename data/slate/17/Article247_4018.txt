            Dear Todd,

            I think what you are describing are those free concerts they hold outside of
the Today show. Particularly the ones by Ricky Martin or Hansen.

            We have switched places today. I am groggy and having a hard time waking up.
I'm not sure if I ate too many waffles or too few. I saw An American
Movie last night, which is a funny documentary about an obsessed young
filmmaker in Wisconsin. Maybe prolonged exposure of any kind to your state
makes people sleep later.

            So now, according to this morning's New York Post , they think that
maybe the co-pilot of that EgyptAir flight was responsible for the crash. They
are saying he was burdened by a lot of medical bills from a sick kid. That he
made a few ominous "in case anything might happen to me" remarks to family
members. You know, the last few years I keep reading reports about all the
controversial "profiling" they are doing at airports, trying to predict the
behavior of suspicious ticket holders. Now it turns out it was the crews they
should have be profiling, not the passengers.

            It's been fun reading the New York Post this week. But it's so weird
how full of odd bits of gossip these New York papers are. Los Angeles is widely
accepted as the less sophisticated of the two cities, yet there are no parallel
publications here. The other morning there was a lengthy item in either the
Post or the Daily News about what the newly slimmer Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani eats for lunch (a chicken Caesar). And I thought to myself, "Gee, how
sad that we in the City of Los Angeles have virtually no idea what's in the
meals of Mayor Dick Riordan."
