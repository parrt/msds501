Hang Gliding to Hoary Marmots"
            

            Wanna play? Click for the
rules.

            This week, we challenge you
to get from the official United States Hang Gliding Association site to this page, which
tells you where
to find hoary marmots.

            We went from majestic
soaring to rodential burrowing in six links. If you can tie or beat that,
e-mail your solution (with instructions and URLs) to FrancisBacon@slate.com by
noon ET Tuesday, March 31. (All submissions will become the property of

                  Slate
                and will be published at 
                  Slate
               's discretion.

                  Slate
                may publish your name on its site in connection with your
submission.)

            Results will be announced
Thursday, April 2, at about 5 p.m. PT, along with a new puzzle. Readers are
also invited to submit their own puzzles (along with a solution path).

            Happy surfing!

            
               Solution
to Puzzle No. 5: "From Beatles to Beetles"
            

            Last week,
we asked readers to get from this page on
The Beatles to this
page on beetles in 15 links or less. Our winner: Reagen Mackie, who got
from lovable mop tops to creepy crawlies in an impressive 12 steps. Viswanath
Subramanian and Tamara Glenny also did the deed in 12 links, but Mackie did it
first--you've got to be pretty quick on the draw around these parts. Here's
Mackie's solution:

            The starting page ...
Beatles

            "Beatles
[Gabe Perlmutter]" (Note: This link goes to a dead page but then
automatically proceeds to his new page, so I'm counting it as one link.)

            "My Page"
(bottom link on left)

            "Science"
(third icon from the top)

            "IGC (Habitats &
Species)" (sixth link in the list)

            "The Smithsonian Natural
History Web" (page down two or three times)

            "Museum Directory"
(last link)

            "Smithsonian Institution"
(bottom right icon)

            "Resources/Tours"
(top right icon)

            "A Kid's Guide to the
Smithsonian" (in the lowest selector window; click Go on a Packaged
Tour )

            "National Museum
of Natural History" (first link)

            "Hiss, Chirp, Rattle, Click!" (10 th link in the
list)

            "feed
themselves"

            Enjoy!

            
Congratulations to Reagen Mackie for racing from Fab Four to insect lore.
