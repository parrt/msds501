            I said, "Dear Larry," as I put down his book,
Elegy ,

            across the street from
the Home Energy Center

            and its two embellished secular Christmas trees

            and its two red wreaths
over red ribbon crosses

            enshrining a thirty inch stove in one of its
windows

            and a fifty gallon water
heater in the other,

            knowing how wise he would have been with the parking
lot

            and the tree that refused
against all odds and all

            sane agreements and codicils to let its dead
leaves

            for God's sake fall in
some kind of trivial decency

            and how he would have stopped with me always beside
him

            to watch a girl in a
white fur parka and boots

            build the first snowball on Northampton Street she
collected

            from the hood of a Ford
Fairlane underneath that tree

            and throw it she thought at a small speed limit
sign

            although it landed with a
fluff just shy of the twin

            painted center lines inducing the three of us,

            her lover, Larry, and I
to make our own snowballs

            from the hoods and fenders of our own Fairlanes
although

            she threw like none of us
and to add to it

            she was left-handed, so bless her, may she have

            a good job and children
and always be free of cancer

            and may the two of us scrape some roofs before
the

            rain relieves us, and may we find gloves for our
labor.
