            Katha,
The reason Russia's economic and social woes are still terrible is related to
the many-decades long genocidal regime that destroyed its polity and economy,
and terrorized half the planet. Economic and social decline were accelerating
in the last years of the evil empire, and any attempt to put them right will
inevitably make some of them worse in the meantime. You can't solve such
problems before you expose them. I remember the pain exacted by Thatcherism in
its early years, when half a century of disastrous socialist economics had
wrought another mess of poverty, stagnation, and resentment. And, of course,
people at first blamed Thatcher, not socialism, for the mess. Now ask
neo-Thatcherite Tony Blair who was really responsible. And Yeltsin's attack on
the Parliament was, in my view, a necessary evil, given the Communist Party's
continuing attempt to derail democratization and market reform. And while there
are plenty of old communist hacks still in charge in Russia, their opposition
to Yeltsin, and the opposition of the big business cartels to his new cabinet,
suggests whose side he's really on. Why won't you give him credit? It still
seems to me part of the Left's inability to come to terms with its intellectual
and moral complicity in the murderous regime in Moscow for several decades that
leaves it reluctant to get clearly and unequivocally on the right side in
today's Russia.

            As to Bill, I agree with you about his enemies, but they are worthy of him.
The responsibility for all this mess lies with the president and him alone, not
with the special prosecutor who was appointed by the Justice Department, for
good and obvious reasons. Again, it seems to me you cannot see the wood for the
trees.

            But you're right. I can't imagine you in tweeds.

            best
Andrew
