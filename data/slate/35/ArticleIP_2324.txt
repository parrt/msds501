            One of the few truths
universally acknowledged about Flytrap is that presidential secretary Betty
Currie deserves our sympathy: an honest, loyal civil servant dragooned into a
scandal she had nothing to do with.

            But does Currie deserve such
sanctification? After all, she knew Clinton's history when she took her job
then enabled Clinton's sleaziness anyway. She stood by while Clinton cuckolded
his wife and perhaps even helped him commit obstruction of justice. And did she
protest? Not as far as we have heard. Did she quit on principle? No. Currie may
not be Flytrap's chief malefactor, but nor is she the saintly innocent that the
American public believes her to be.

            The
Currie case suggests that Flytrap needs a moral recalibration.

            Monica Lewinsky, for example, has fantastically low
approval ratings, much lower than Clinton's. One poll I saw pegged her
favorability rating at 5 percent (even Newt Gingrich manages at least 25
percent). Now, Monica certainly isn't the heroine of Flytrap. She did seduce a
married man, damage the presidency for the sake of casual sex, lie frequently
and insouciantly, and blab her "secret" affair to anyone who'd listen. But she
was also sexually exploited by her older, sleazy boss; had her reputation
smeared by Clinton's lackeys; and was betrayed by her "friend" Linda Tripp. She
hardly deserves such universal contempt.

            Others besides Currie have
benefited from the public's excessive generosity. George Stephanopoulos has
become a white knight of Flytrap, the former Clinton aide who had the courage
to turn on his boss. And bravo to George for chastising Clinton! But it smacks
of hypocrisy for Stephanopoulos to "discover" in 1998 that Clinton is a lying,
womanizing dog. He has, after all known this since 1992. Back then
Stephanopoulos himself helped quell bimbo eruptions and parroted Clinton's
lying denials. He has never shouldered blame for those deceptions. (Mickey Kaus
first noted Stephanopoulos' unbearable sanctimony in this "Chatterbox" item in January.) And while loyalty isn't a universal
good, it was opportunistic for Stephanopoulos to betray Clinton just at the
moment Clinton's stock was about to plunge.

            
(Sometimes, of course, the public's rating is dead on target. Linda Tripp's
allies--a group that includes her lawyers, Kenneth Starr, the Goldberg family,
and absolutely no one else as far as I can tell--have tried repeatedly to
improve her sorry public image. Jonah Goldberg tried right here in Slate. No sale.)

            
Below is 
                  Slate
               's entire
scorecard, which ranks 31 of Flytrap's key players: The scale runs from -10 to
+10. Anything less than zero means the player is a net miscreant. Anything
above zero rates a sympathy card. (This is not, of course, an exact science.
How, for example, do we judge Ann Lewis compared to other last ditch Clinton
defenders? Lewis is said to be more outraged by Clinton's misbehavior than The
Guys in the White House. Yet Lewis didn't quit in disgust. Is her outrage a
plus or a minus if she doesn't act on it? You decide.)

Scorecard

            
               Bill
Clinton (The public's rating: -6 )

            Minuses:

            To recapitulate

            a) Had an adulterous affair
with a young intern.

            b) Lied about it to
everyone .

            c) Probably perjured
himself.

            d) Perhaps obstructed
justice.

            e) Entangled allies and aides
in his web of deceit.

            f) Humiliated his wife and
daughter.

            g) Did not have the grace to
apologize to Lewinsky.

            h)Tried to shift the blame
for his failures onto his accusers.

            Pluses:

            a) Had his private life
exposed to the world in a way no one's should be.

            b) Has
been persecuted by enemies who won't be satisfied until he is destroyed.

               Dick
Morris (The public's rating: -6 )

            Minuses:

            a) Encouraged Clinton's most
deplorable habits: lying and polling. (When Clinton revealed his adultery to
Morris, the political consultant immediately took a poll to see how America
would respond to a Clinton admission. When the results suggested Americans
would be angry if Clinton had perjured himself, Morris encouraged Clinton to
deny the affair.)

            b) Further sullied the
Clintons with a revolting comment suggesting that Clinton cheats because
Hillary is a lesbian.

            c) Not even loyal enough to
keep his mouth shut.

            Pluses: I cannot think of
any.

"friend."

            b) Obsessively nosed into
the private lives of others.

            c) Tried to score a book
deal off sex gossip and other people's distress.

            d) Tattletale.

            Pluses:

            a) Whistleblower (see d
under Minuses): risked humiliation to expose something she believed was
wrong.

            b)
Smeared mercilessly by Clinton allies, the media.

Carville (The public's rating: -1 )

            
Minuses:

            a) Has known about Clinton's
woman problem since 1992.

            b) Happily parroted
Clinton's denial despite knowing that Clinton was a deceitful womanizer.

            c) Has not expressed the
slightest chagrin or disappointment since Clinton's apology.

            d) Has not retreated from
vicious attacks on Starr, despite evidence of Clinton's lies.

            Pluses:

            a) Perfectly loyal.

            b)
Consistent in attacks against Starr.

            a) Not yet known what he did
to protect Clinton from the Lewinsky affair. Early signs suggest he knew a lot
and helped clean it up.

            Pluses:

            a) Unquestionably loyal to
his boss.

            Minuses:

            a) May have known and must
have suspected that Lewinsky was a mistress (given that he and Clinton are
confidants, it's hard to believe that Jordan was totally in the dark about
her).

            b) Protected too readily by
Washington establishment.

            Pluses:

            a) May
have helped Lewinsky simply because he's bighearted and generous not because
she was the president's lover.

denial for months without bothering to check if it was true.

            b) Pushed for Clinton to be
aggressive rather than contrite during his speech.

            c) Trumpeted Clinton's
denial but has not expressed chagrin now that Clinton has admitted his
lies.

            Pluses:

            a) Consistent in belief that
Starr is an ideologue and that the sex charges are political.

denial for months without bothering to check if it was true.

            b) Said for seven months
that we'd have to "wait and see." Then, when Clinton finally admitted his lies,
Davis was hardly embarrassed or critical of the president.

            Pluses:

was a lech in 1992 and helped cover it up. Yet he has never shouldered
responsibility for the lies Clinton told then.

            b) Disloyal to turn on old
boss as viciously as he has in past few weeks.

            Pluses:

            a) Had courage to turn on old
boss and criticize his moral lapses.

            b) Urged
Clinton to be fully contrite.

into when she took the job so can't be excused on grounds of naiveté.

wiles.

            e) Protected herself with
immunity when she needed to, even though her testimony would do enormous harm
to Clinton and the nation.

            f) Blabbed her "secret"
affair to lots of people. (So, while she was dragged into the scandal against
her will, it was her own loquaciousness that made the dragging possible.)

            Pluses:

            a) Sexually exploited by her

               Al
Gore (The public's rating: +3 )

            
Minuses:

            a) Did not (apparently) urge
the president to come clean with American people.

            Pluses:

            a) Stayed loyal.

            b) Did
not take advantage of scandal to burnish his own image.

               Kathleen
Willey (The public's rating: 0 )

            
Minuses:

            a) Was in it for the money
(told her story partly in order to land a book contract).

            Pluses:

            a) Seems to have told story
honestly and forthrightly.

            b) Reluctantly dragged into
scandal.

            c) Was
victimized by Clinton.

               The
Clinton Cabinet (The public's rating: +2 )

            
Minuses:

            a) Spun his denials without
digging for the truth.

            b) Did not quit on
principle.

            Pluses:

            a) Were conscripted
unwillingly into scandal defense. (Unlike political aides such as Begala, who
are expected to do political dirty work, the Cabinet members are public
servants who should be kept away from such sleaze.)

            b) Were lied to by
Clinton.

            c)
Loyal.

               Erskine
Bowles (The public's rating: Doesn't care )

            Minuses:

            a) Refused to involve himself
in the critical issue of the presidency.

            b) Stood aside while White
House was shanghaied by lawyers.

            Pluses:

            a) Stayed utterly silent
about the scandal, clearly disgusted by it all.

            b) Kept the rest of the
administration focused on policy, thus preventing total executive
paralysis.

            c) Did not
lie or spin for the president.

            Minuses:

            There are none yet.

            Pluses:

            a)
(Mostly) kept his mouth shut and prevented the House Judiciary Committee from
jumping the gun on impeachment.

               Secret
Service (The public's rating: +8 )

            
Minuses:

            a) Fought Starr subpoena too
hard because it considers itself the Praetorian Guard.

            Pluses:

            a) Dragged unwillingly into
scandal by Clinton (unlike Currie or his political aides, the Secret Service
agents have no choice about being near the president).

            b) Testified honestly but
unwillingly, as they should.

            c) Did
not leak.

Clinton (The public's rating: +10 )

            There are none.

            a) Humiliated and
embarrassed by her father's misbehavior.

paraded before the world in a way they should not be.

            c) Has been endlessly
psychologized by the media.

            d) Had
her summer vacation ruined.
