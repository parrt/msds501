            Yes, I had some nice things to say about Bradley's
campaign, especially the bold and clear speeches he's made on a variety of
issues (particularly health care), but I've also had some nice things to say in
the past year about Gore, Bush and McCain. I think they're all running
suprisingly substantive campaigns and deserve some credit for that. But I
haven't "endorsed" anyone, or come close. (In fact, I have no idea whom I'll be
voting for).

            My own father died less than a year after I was
born; I never really knew him. A career military officer, he left my mother and
his four children little in an economic sense, but the mementos of his life,
including photographs, his military decorations and the memories of those whose
lives he touched, are cherished to this day. Even in the midst of his loss, Mr.
Stein should be grateful to have enjoyed the company of his parents into their
old age; even if we don't realize it at the time, each and every moment that we
have with our loved ones should be considered, and treated as, a blessing.

            I enjoy Ben Stein's TV show, but the essay is
troubling. The tribute to his father is touching and well-deserved, but his
views on the estate tax are appalling.

            At no point does he tell the reader the size of the
initial exemption. In fact, estates must exceed at least $600,00 before ANY tax
is applied. It is my impression that only 1 percent to 2 percent of all estates
are subject to any tax. This is not class warfare. This is sensible economic
and public policy. Many of the wealthy realized the benefits of disbursing
wealth at death (A. Carnegie, e.g.). Ben Stein should know better than to make
the occasion of his father's death into a political complaint.

            I am in the business of estate tax planning. With a
modicum of planning, Mr. Stein's father could have seriously reduced or
eliminated the amount of taxes that were payable by his estate. It is also true
that while Ben's mother certainly deserved to share in his father's largess,
Ben and any other siblings were merely members of the "lucky sperm club."

            We all take something out of society. We all should
put something back into society. Mr. Stein's father, whom I disagreed with on a
good many things, did put something into society, besides taxes. But assume he
had not; should he or anyone else be allowed to accumulate substantial wealth
or should it be filtered back into the society from whence it came and from
whence it might do more public good? I will leave that question for the
philosophers and politicians.

Irish as Cultural Badge

            Dennis Baron writes with reference to another
minority language that "[c]ultural-loyalty movements like the class in Navajo
tend to spring up when cultural preservation is in danger, and their record of
success is not impressive."

            I would add that it depends on who starts the
class. Irish is a minority language closely associated with Irish culture and
sometimes with Irish nationalism. Some of the most positive Irish-speakers are
those who have acquired what they call "prison Irish." Not necessarily studied
in prisons in Northern Ireland, this is Irish learned on a need-to-know basis,
but a cultural need to know. If these speakers don't fashion this
connection to Irishness they feel otherwise culturally deprived, to a greater
or lesser degree. The most enthusiastic speakers I have ever met are not native
speakers who grow up in comfortable government-subsidized Irish-only
neighborhoods in Galway, but those who have clawed their way to a brand of
cultural Irishness that they choose to mark by the use of language.

            So I wonder if there isn't a proviso that
cultural-loyalty movements of language revival may be likely to fail if they
are instituted by the government, but perhaps more likely to succeed if they
are instituted in spite of the government. Because state-supported Irish in the
Republic of Ireland has a much more temperamental success rate. Most Irish
people there seem to feel that their culture is plenty intact without this
old-fashioned language dragging them further back behind the rest of Europe. Is
Irish a special language case?

            I and my co-workers happen to be Ebonics speakers.
We are all young, urban "heads" ( heads is "ebonics" for "people") who
run a multimedia company. We speak our own urbanized form of computer
tech-speak a lot of the time because we find that terms like "information
superhighway" and "surf the web" are just not compatible with an urban
lifestyle. How many kids from Harlem have been surfing? Naw'meen?

            I myself speak Ebonics, so-called Proper English,
some Hebrew, some Spanish, some Arabic, and media techno-babble. I've blended
all of these together into my own urban Renaissance language. I think that
people need to communicate so there should be a shared mode of communication,
but, acting like so-called proper American English is more than a "slang
dialect" itself is just wrong. I mean, we do NOT speak the Queen's English, nor
would we want to. Further, English itself is just a bastardized version of
other languages like French, German, Latin, and eventually Sanskrit.

            So before the next time one of these language
elitists rolls up into a 7-11 and talks trash about the Indian guy behind the
counter speaking broken English, he should instead thank the Indian guy because
his precious English language was "invented" by the Indians' ancestors.

            Shalom.

Martha: Architectural Digest for the Masses

            Martha, and her many imitators, have taught us how
to make our houses into homes. Before Martha, the many domestic arts and
sciences were divided between "homey" but provincial cooking and Sears-style
decorating, on the one hand, and the haute cuisine of Julia Child and
decorating by Architectural Digest on the other. Martha taught the
new, educated and traveled middle class how to find a middle ground for
decorating and cooking. Her style remains essentially that.

            If you disagree--then compare Martha Stewart
Living with Architectural Digest . If the great unwashed wish to
serve beer in bottles and an open bag of chips and Velveeta on triskits on the
picnic table out back, as opposed to Martha-inspired delicacies-crudités and
margaritas, so what? Why does she need to be so vociferously criticized? Why do
the hoi polloi feel so threatened by her and her style? She never feels
threatened by THEM and she has NEVER, despite what the many parodies say,
preached AGAINST a more casual style of entertaining or said her way was the
ONLY way.

            I'm sure your readers know that the very name
"Martha" is no accident. "Martha" has represented domesticity for almost two
millennia, when she complained to their guest Jesus that her sister Mary was
spending all her time listening at the feet of Jesus, while she, Martha, had to
work serving. Jesus' answer is classic: "Martha, Martha, thou art careful and
troubled about many things. But one thing is needful; and Mary hath chosen that
good part, which shall not be taken away from her" [Luke 10:38-42]. Thus "Mary"
represents intellect and devotion, which trumps domestic chores. But nowadays
"Mary" won't get very far with an IPO.
