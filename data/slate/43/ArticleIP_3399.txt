            When people say they miss
me,I think how much I miss me too,Me, the old me, the great me,Lover of three
women in one day,Modest me, the best me, friend To waiters and bartenders,
heartyLaugher and name rememberer,Proud me, handsome and hirsuteIn soccer shoes
and shortsOn the ball fields behind MIT,Strong me in a weightbelt at the
gym,Mutual sweat dripper in and out Of the sauna, furtive observerOf the
coeducated and scantily clad,Speedy me, cyclist of rivers,Goose and peregrine
falconCounter, all season venturer,Chatterer-up of corner cops,Groundskeepers,
mothers with strollers,Outwitter of panhandlers and billCollectors, avoider of
levies, excises,Me in a taxi in the rain,Pressing my luck all the way home.

            That's me at the dice
table, baby,Betting come, little joe, and yo,Blowing the coals, laying
thunder,My foot on top a fifty dollar chipSome drunk spilled on the
floor,Dishonest me, evener of scores,Eager accepter of the extra change,Hotel
towel pilferer, coffee spoonLifter, fervent retailer of others'Humor,
blackhearted gossiper,Poisoner at the well, dwellerIn unsavory detail,
delighted sayerOf the vulgar, off course belierOf the true me, empiric
builderNewly haircutted, stickerer-upFor pals, jam unpriser, medicTo the
self-inflicted, attorneyTo the self-indicted, petty accountantAnd keeper of the
double books,Great divider of the universeAnd all its forms of existenceInto
its relationship to me,Fellow trembler to the future,Thin air gawker,
apprehenderOf the frameless door.
