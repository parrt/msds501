            A
month ago, "Frame Game" that Steve Forbes had begun to delete the word
"abortion" from his comments about abortion, substituting the phrase "the life
issue." By talking about "the life issue," Forbes signals to pro-lifers that
he's one of them, while concealing from pro-choicers that he's no longer one of
them.

            Here's
what Forbes said about abortion in his speech at the Iowa straw poll last
weekend:

            
               Now, the issue of life
is one of the most emotional and heartfelt in America. Like you, I am pro-life
and believe in the life amendment. But many in America don't share our goal,
but that doesn't mean we put our principles aside. The highest form of
statesmanship is to find ways to bring people towards our goal. And I believe
that if we move forward with persistence, patience, engaging in a dialogue, we
can change the hearts and minds of the American people. And I believe that if
we do persist, the time will come--I have faith that the time will come when
once again life will be held sacred in our hearts, in our homes, in our
Congress, in our courts, and, yes, in our Constitution.
            

            And
here's what Forbes said about candidates who fudge their positions:

            
               If a candidate won't
tell you where he stands, that means he either doesn't know where he stands or
he doesn't want you to know where he stands, and either one is not good for you
or the American people.
            

            So,
let's try again. Where do you stand on abortion, Mr. Forbes?
