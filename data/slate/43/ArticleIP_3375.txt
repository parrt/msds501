            We don't live near a
stream, but now we do:the water slipping down the side of the street

            would shame many a river
with a big nameinscribed on space shots, with a history, with

            fish; three or four inches
this morning and more coming: a flotation medium rising in the

            basement, alas, a mop and
bucket my squeezingremedy: and Phyllis off at a funeral:

            put down in this much
water, one could drown;at least, get wet: but what does the body

            care that has no spirit in
it: it has alreadydrowned in a medium sleep pales before: and

            the spirit, even: it was
just a bit of electricity firing off joints and nets: off,

            it isn't there anymore:
the body, though, isbut it has taken on the temperature of the

            ground and sees no
difference in itself: oh,but the difference to some! a lifetime's

            worth of getting on with
life: it is just thatquick cut between getting our monographs

            published about horse
fever and keeping the drainfree below the rainspout and putting a little

            aside for the kids'
education and--BOP--gone:I have so much trouble with that edge: the

            day-to-day plunged into
eternity: the look back then from eternity to the day-to-day:

            what was it all about,
what was the use, howdid we get so interested, so worried, so

            anxious: I say, meaning
cannot be criticizedby time: where does time get off: while there

            is meaning: when anything
has served its purposeit might as well be abandoned, even meaning:

            but meaning
is really good while it lasts: toobad you can't store it up anywhere for a
