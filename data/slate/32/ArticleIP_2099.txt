            I wish to issue a forceful
denial of sexual relations with that man, President Bill Clinton. I never told
anyone to lie about it. Any intimation that our relationship was improper will
be a source of deep distress to me, to my husband of many years, and to other
members of my family.

            While I
have met with the president at the White House on occasion, I did so only to
discuss matters relating to family structure, teen-age pregnancy, and social
consequences. Any elation or dishevelment observed in me upon leaving those
meetings was strictly professional. I just have that kind of hair. All the
White House faxes, memos, and other messages I have in my possession deal with
subjects such as I detail above.

            Ihave examined the five copies of the poetry of Khalil
Gibran in my library and find no inscription from the president of the United
States in any of them. All items of underwear in my possession were purchased
either by me or by my widowed mother. While items of my clothing are currently
at the cleaners, I can provide explanations for all the spots.

            My recent orthopedic
difficulties were in no way related to any unwillingness on my part to discuss
these or any other matters with attorneys for Paula Jones, Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr, or the media.

            I deny any implication that
the character of Dave Cranston in my still-to-be-published novel, Secondary
Powers , was based upon my intimate knowledge of any real person. Readers
can judge for themselves.
