            You know, one of the consequences of watching Blazing Saddles many
times, at an early age, is that I can never see Hedy Lamarr's name without
recalling this classic exchange from that movie:

            

               Woman in Front of Grauman's Chinese Theater: "Look! I'm in Hedy Lamarr's
shoes!"

               Harvey Korman, Playing a Character Named Hedley Lamarr: (Irritably.) "That's
Hedley!"

            

            It is much, much funnier than it seems here. I guess, for the joke to work,
Harvey Korman has to say it. And how often is that the case?

            So, I think our "Breakfast Table" time is winding down. One final item: Did
you see that Abe Rosenthal now has a column at the New York Daily News ?
I think the person I'd least like to have been yesterday--aside from Hedy
Lamarr--is the Times writer who had to report this story. I have this
image of him wandering around the newsroom, saying, "So, what word do I use to
describe the circumstances under which he left? Do I ask Abe about whether or
not he's bitter? Do I make it seem like a coup for the News ? Can I use
the term 'widely unread' to describe 'On My Mind'?" (The answers, as best I can
tell from Glenn Collins' story: "Departed." No. Yes. No.) Rosenthal is quoted
as saying that he doesn't know what his first column is going to be about. I'm
wagering five bucks it's titled, "Max Frankel Is a Wuss." Any takers?
