            Dear Andrew,

            The other day you referred to affirmative action as "reverse racial
discrimination," which in my view characterizes it most inaccurately. Then,
yesterday, you joshed about the Catholic all-male priesthood as the ultimate
affirmative action program (as if men, of all people, had been the victim of
discrimination for which the monopoly on ordination was a recompense!). Rather
than rant and rave (I'm saving that for my column, due this morning) I'd like
to know what your plan is for remedying racial discrimination in this country.
In particular, I'm thinking of the story out at Berkeley, where affirmative
action has been banned, and where only around 191 blacks, out of 8000-plus
admittees, have been offered a place in next year's class, a huge drop (the
Hispanic number was also small). In an interesting letter to the Washington Post earlier this week, Rene Redwood noted
that "800 of the rejected African American and Latino applicants...had grade
point averages of 4.0 and SAT scores of more than 1200. How can that be?
Because a student can get a higher grade point average if he or she is
fortunate enough to go to a high school that offers a full range of advanced
placement courses, which poor urban school districts are less likely to do.

            "We are not talking about differences of ability here. We are talking about
students having had unequal opportunities to demonstrate that ability. Asking
that disparate opportunity be taken into account is not a 'preference.'"

            Redwood argues that "affirmative action is one tool for breaking the chain
of unfairness." How do you propose to break that chain? If a good student can't
get extra points because their school doesn't offer extra courses, why is it
"discrimination" to take that into account?

            Cheers,
Katha
