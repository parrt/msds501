            Subscribers who receive our weekly printer-friendly
text edition, 
                  Slate on Paper
               , should have received by now an
e-mail message containing the MySlate tool, a k a "the Wasserman." It is named
after Rich Wasserman of Kirkland, Wash., a 
                  Slate
                subscriber who
took up the challenge of producing a way to print out selected articles from

                  Slate on Paper
                rather than the whole thing. The tool comes as a
Word document with an Install button and simple instructions. Once it's
installed, whenever you have 
                  Slate on Paper
                on your screen you
can call up a menu of articles with check boxes to pick the ones you want. (You
can even choose between all the items in a multi-item department like
"Chatterbox" or only some of them.) Then the tool will print out your personal
edition of 
                  Slate
               , formatted in two columns for 8 1/2-by-11 paper,
with its own table of contents, containing just the stuff you want. Note: This
gizmo only works with Word 97. But if you've got the right word processor--and
if, for some reason, you don't wish to consume every word of

                  Slate
               --the Wasserman is pretty cool. Thanks, Rich.

            
               
                  Slate on Paper
                itself is
readable and printable by any version of Word (6.0 or later), by recent
versions of most other major word processors, or by Word Viewer, a free bit of
software (which you may already have as part of Windows 95 or 98). There's also
a version for Adobe Acrobat or a free Acrobat viewer. 
                  Slate on
Paper
