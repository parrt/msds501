               Our
Revels Now Are Ended
            

            This week brings the end of
our experimental novel-by-e-mail, Reply All. For the
past year, three authors in three cities--Washington, New York, and Los
Angeles--have been e-mailing one another in the personae of three characters in
their respective locations. Little did they know when they began--the
characters or the authors--that they'd get tangled up with Monica, Ken, Linda,
Lucianne, and the equally colorful goings-on of our real-life melodrama. If
only the writers could bring that one to a conclusion as well.

            The entire 44 chapter
Reply All saga can be downloaded as a Microsoft Word or
an Adobe
Acrobat document. It's about 60 pages.

            And now that it's over, we
can reveal the identities of the authors: in Los Angeles, the screenwriter Erik
Tarloff, whose novel about Washington, Face-Time , will be published in
January by Crown; in New York, the novelist Francine Prose; and, in Washington
... well, he or she would lose his or her job, so we'd still better not
say.

            Our
thanks to all six of them--authors, characters--for an entertaining year.
