               "We're not hiding
it," says Capt. Michael Fallon of the Hartford Police Department, hoping to
ease community fears. In fact, they plan to take it to fairs so children can
climb on it and have their pictures taken with it. What?

               Wednesday's
Question (No. 245)--"Dis Sent":
            

            

               
                  
                     
                        
                           Gerald Vollmer-Heurer has a plan, and
Dirk Adol hates it. "It is cheap, it is degrading, it is smelly," says Mr.
Adol, who has a plan of his own. "What I propose is something clean, useful and
solid." What is the subject of Dirk and Gerald's
disagreement?

               Randy's Rare
Personal Wrap-Up
            

            Neil Simon himself flew
in for opening night of the München dinner theater production; that much I'm
sure of. And I remember the first scene; the boys are playing poker.

            Dirk: Gerald, you are such
neat! Too such!

            
Gerald: Nein, Dirk, das ist nicht ein Schveinhause!
            

            After that, all I recall
is searing intestinal pain. I think I had a bad piece of bratwurst. But whether
it was the deft comic performances (James Coco as Gerald; a 50-gallon drum of
sauerkraut as Dirk) or Doc's brilliant writing, something about that evening
left a lasting impression. Years later, in the middle of one of our
all-too-frequent quarrels, I said to my wife: "Oh, honey, what's happened to
us? We used to be so happy, and now we fight like Dirk and Gerald!" And she
replied, paraphrasing Dr. Johnson, "When a man grows tired of cheap, degrading,
and smelly, he's grown tired of life, you jerk." The next morning, we flew to
Vegas and renewed our vows.

            
               X Deutsche Marks
the Spot Answer
            

            The two men have competing ideas for disposing of
the 2,600 tons of German paper money that nation will discard as it switches
over to the euro.

            Vollmer-Heurer proposes mixing the old bills with
rotting garbage and animal excrement to produce compost. Adol has a method for
shaping shredded bills into pellets and using those as an ingredient in
lightweight bricks with excellent insulating properties.

            "Building pellets or
manure," muses a philosophical Karl Schnitzler of the Bavarian State Central
Bank, "the question is secondary. The mark will soon be history, and what
matters is the stability of the currency in use."
