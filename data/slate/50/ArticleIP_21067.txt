               In the '60s it happened to 95 percent of American boys; today it's down
to 60 percent, and a policy just announced by the American Academy of
Pediatrics is meant to make it happen even less. What?

he announced on the radio that if it were legal to do it again he would.
Opponents say this desire indicates "a strange psychological state." Who wants
to do what?

Wrap-Up
            

            Many of your suggestions
involved actions that, while amusing and cruel, are not illegal but merely
unlikely (Most men would be too scared to lift it while the monkey was in the
room.), unappetizing (With a human femur? Not in my copy of Joy of
Cooking !), or in direct contradiction of the laws of physics (Sure, naked
and on the surface of the moon--but here on Earth? I doubt it.). You know who
you are.

               Born To Run
Answer
            

            Over the weekend, Argentina's President Carlos Saúl
Menem said he'd like to seek re-election, but his country's constitution
forbids three consecutive terms. In addition, a 1995 amendment specifically
prohibits Menem from running again. Former President Raúl Alfonsín thinks Menem
is just nuts, but Menem said Alfonsín should be ignored because "he couldn't
govern the country."

            Yesterday Menem again
reversed himself, announcing that he'd retire at the conclusion of his
term.
