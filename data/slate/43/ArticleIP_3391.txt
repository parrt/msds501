            Like the waxwings in the
juniper,a dozen at a time, divided, paired,passing the berries back and forth,
and bynightfall, wobbling, piping, wounded with joy.

            Or a party of redwings
grazing whatfalls--blossom and seed, nutmeat and fruit--made light in the head
and cut by the light,swept from the ground, carried downwind, taken ...

            It's called wing-rowing,
the wing-burdened armsunbending, yielding, striking a balance,walking the white
invisible line drawnjust ahead in the air, first sign the slur,

            the liquid notes too
liquid, the heart in the mouth melodious, too close, which startsthe chanting,
the crooning, the long lyricsilences, the song of our undoing.

            It's called side-step,
head-forward, raised-crown, flap-and-glide-flight aggression, though courtship
isthe object, affection the compulsion,love the overspill--the body
nodding,

            still standing, ready to
fly straight out ofitself--or it's bill-tilt, wing-flash, topple-over;
wing-droop, bowing, tail-flick and drift;back-ruffle, wing-spread, quiver and
soar.

            Someone is troubled,
someone is trying,in earnest, to explain; to speak without swallowing the
tongue; to find the perfectword among so few or the too many--

            to sing like the thrush
from the deepest partof the understory, territorial,carnal,
thorn-at-the-throat, or flutelikein order to make one sobering sound.

            Sound of the breath blown
over the bottle,sound of the reveler home at dawn, light of the sun a warbler
yellow, the sun insong-flight, lopsided-pose. Be of good cheer,

            my father
says, lifting his glass to greet a morning in which he's awake to bewith the
birds: or up all night in the sleepof the world, alive again, singing.
