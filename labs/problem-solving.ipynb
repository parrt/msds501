Given a string, the function must return an encrypted version and the decryption key (the key is the reverse mapping of the cipher and is needed to decrypt). The cipher is a dictionary that maps character to a new character. A cipher encryption works by replacing each character in the plaintext with a character from a key.  For example, if we have the following partial key, we'd encrypt `cat` as `nsz` and `taca` as `zsns`."

    "### Subproblem How could somebody guess our randomized mapping of characters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, these simple ciphers fall immediately to character frequency analysis, as long as we have enough characters in the sample to get an accurate picture of character frequencies. For example, in English the letter `e` has the highest frequency so we replace the character with the highest frequency in the encrypted text with `e` and so on down the frequency list.  As we go along, we look for words in English dictionary or sequences that are close to endless words.  It's like a game of Jeopardy where we try to guess a phrase given some of the characters. We can also look at most common word pairs like `th` to tease out the original plaintext.

    "\n",
    "As we will see in the data acquisitions class, a very common pattern is to collect some data from the web and process it in some way.  Let's get started  by downloading a CSV file from the web that contains information on [cities in various states](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/cities.csv) from the US. We could simply download that file onto our local disk, but let's do this automatically with a program. \n",

    "Let's say our next goal is to filter out any cities that are not in Washington state, code `WA`.   Let's finish up by saving those `WA` rows back to a text file, `/tmp/wa_cities.csv`, in CSV format. We'll avoid using pandas initially and then do it again with pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, think about the overall sequence of steps needed to solve this problem at a high level; totally ignore the coding issues. In my mind, there are three things to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the CSV file as a string\n",
    "2. Filter for just the `WA` states\n",
    "3. Write those rows to a new text file\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of details we need to flesh out for each step, but it's important to start at a high level before drilling down into the details.\n",
    "\n",
    "For step one, a quick Google search reveals that there is a package called `requests` for Python that allows us to download files easily so let's do that and take a look at what we get:"
