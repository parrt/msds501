            whose home is in the
strawand bailing twine threadedin the slots of a roof vent

            who guards a tiny
ledgeagainst the starlingsthat cruise the neighborhood

            whose heart is smallerthan
a heart should be,whose feathers stiffen

            like an arrow fret to
quickenthe hydraulics of its wings,stay there on the metal

            ledge, widen your
alarmingbeak, but do not flee as others haveto the black walnut vaulting

            overhead. Do not move
outsidethe world you've madefrom bailing twine and straw.

            The isolated starling
fearsthe crows, the crows gang upto rout a hawk. The hawk

            is cold. And cold is whata
larger heart maintains.The owl at dusk and dawn,

            far off, unseen, but
audible,repeats its syncopated intervals,a song that's not a cry

            but a whisper rising from
concentricrings of water spreading out acrossthe surface of a catchment
pond.

            It asks, "Who are you?
Whoare you?" but no one knows.Stay where you are, nervous, jittery.

            Move your small head a
hundredways, a hundred times, keeppaying attention to the terrifying

            world. And if you see the
Robinsin their dirty orange vestspatrolling the yard like thugs,

            forget about the worm.
Starveyourself, or from the air inhalethe water you may need, digest

            the dust. And what the
promiscuouscat and jaybirds do, let themdo it, let them dart and snipe,

            let them sound like
others.They sleep when the owl sendsout its encircling question.

            Stay where
you are, you lit fuse,you dull spark of saltpeter and sulfur.
