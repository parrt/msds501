            I heard about the workplace anger survey this morning on NPR. If I
understand it correctly, this "study" was issued by a marketing company whose
"research" consisted largely, or maybe entirely, of reading the results of a
1996 Gallup poll. That strikes me as a shade less than clinically reliable; in
fact, it makes me angry!

            Still, I can relate to the anger-at-work crowd. It's silly to blame the
Internet, but I would argue that technology is a major factor. It's not just
the increasing complexity of technology, but our increased reliance on it. As
someone whose work life is largely "remote," I can testify to the frustration
at high-tech stuff that just doesn't function as it should. The simple process
of my filing a timely story for the Standard's Web site can get
amazingly clogged. Editors and other managers get in the habit of thinking that
properly working technology is a given; in fact, it's more like a best-case
scenario. Take their high expectations against shoddy machine or network
performance and you've got a sure-fire recipe for office rage.

            Did you see the Mike Judge movie Office Space ? Like all his work,
it's uneven. But my favorite scene is where three disgruntled software
technicians take a constantly malfunctioning printer out to a field, and
proceed to kick the living toner out of the thing. It's all shot in slow
motion, like a mob pounding from a Coen Brothers film, with a nasty rap
soundtrack.

            Kicking the printer,
Jim
