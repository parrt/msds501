        Hotel prices in Lisbon have risen in recent years to match
        most western European destinations, even surpassing popular cities like
        Barcelona at the top levels. Many hotels offer special packages (such
        as summer or weekend reductions).
        Central Lisbon covers the area from the waterfront, Bairro
        Alto, Lapa, and Avenida da Liberdade. North Lisbon refers to the area
        around and beyond Praça Marquês de Pombal. Pousadas, found beyond
        Lisbon, are government-owned hotels and inns; the ones listed occupy
        historic buildings, and their restaurants are usually among the towns
        best.
        The price indication given is for a double room, with
        breakfast, including service and taxes (currently 5 percent of room
        price) in high season (generally April–October).
