            Now, Andrew, you know perfectly well that I support the right of gays to
marry, for exactly the reasons of civil liberties and civil rights you cite.
You even anthologized my essay on the subject. So please don't get on your high
horse about gay marriage with me.

            And who exactly is this "left" that shuns "fidelity and bourgeois bliss"?
Outside some small gay subcultures, like Sex Panic, I think there are few who
take this position on principle -- i.e. yes you must have sex outside your
relationship, and no, you can't have a nice quiet domestic life with children
and a house. (I don't know that I'd call Linda and Paul, world-class
celebrities and millionaires many times over, "bourgeois," exactly, by the
way.) In practice, of course, people of all political persuasions are
unfaithful and choose other things -- fame, power,excitement, variety,
attention, distance -- over making a sane, responsible life with a loved
partner. And many -- especially in the gay world and maybe the White House
too-- have "bourgeois bliss" with a life partner and sexual excitement
somewhere else. I don't think politics has much to do with these intimate only
half-conscious decisions, it comes from someplace deeper.

            Face it, Andrew: as ideology,family values rule, left, right and center! In
practice, they compete with all the other exigencies and opportunities of
reality and human nature.

            Just for the record: my own relationship is so square it's cubic. It's just
not a legal marriage. I think you are making a mistake to equate distaste for
wedlock with libertinism. There are many more than two sides to these
issues!

            Cheers,
Katha
