Lott, Ronald Reagan, and Steve Martin did it when they were young, and this
summer more than 400,000 people will attend camps to learn how to do it better.

opinion handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11 th
Circuit: "The courts are saying 'We'll just have a local option on the
Constitution, and you people down there in Alabama can go ahead and
_____________ all you want.'

Wrap-Up
            

            The French mock the British, the British mock the
French, the Serbs kill the Albanians, the Albanians kill the Serbs--ah, that
crazy regional humor. But our anti-Southern jabs, above, are more than the
ordinary scorn of neighbor vs. neighbor, more than urban vs. rural. Most of our
jibes work a rich vein of educated vs. uneducated, which is another way of
saying rich vs. poor. It's class warfare played out as a barnyard bestiality
joke. What those dumb hicks really lack is the wherewithal for a fine
university education that will lead to a job in the go-go tech sector.

            There is one detail of
Southern japes that has inverted its class associations. Several centuries ago,
incestuous liaisons were for the aristocracy, now they're farmyard fun. In the
former case, incest was a symptom of decadence, in the latter it's just rural
isolation and the lack of dating opportunities. Them folks don't need loftier
morals, they need a Starbucks.

Answer
            

            "You people down there in Alabama can go ahead and
pray over the intercom all you want."

            An opinion from a three-judge panel from the
11 th circuit allows students to conduct organized prayers in school
as long as they don't actively proselytize, and as long as school personnel
have no direct role.

            School officials said one change will be that
pre-game prayers will now be conducted without the coach.

            Chandler called the
decision, allowing students to use state facilities to foster religion,
"hideously unprincipled." The ACLU is expected to appeal.

Ichthys Follow-Up
            

            The Catholic
Encyclopedia says:

            
               Among the symbols employed by the primitive Christians, that of the
fish ranks probably first in importance. Its popularity was due principally to
the famous acrostic consisting of the initial letters of five Greek words
forming the word for fish (Ichthys), which briefly but clearly described the
character of Christ and His claim to the worship of believers: Iesous Christos
Theou Yios Soter, i.e. Jesus Christ, Son of God, Saviour.
            

            You've probably seen the
bumper stickers of the fish symbol inscribed with Greek letters IX(TH)YS (iota
chi theta upsilon sigma). Lately there have been stickers in which the fish has
sprouted feet and eyes and is inscribed "Darwin." A couple of months ago in
Atlanta I saw the Darwinian whatever being swallowed by a larger fish,
inscribed "TRUTH." And the beat goes on.

            Many a company about to launch its Web site
discovers to its dismay that its name is already taken, part of the speculative
frenzy in domain names. In that case, they can either buy the name from its
owner or, with ingenuity, devise an alternative.
