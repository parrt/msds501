            Andrew,

                   You sent me scurrying to the New York Times business pages and
there I found a potential solution for one of my life's peskiest problems. A
French company is now producing a tiny little car that seats just two, weighs
only 770 pounds, goes 27 miles per hour, costs about 10 percent more than the
next-smallest regular kind of car (after all, this is France, where la vie
coute cher )--and, thanks to a legal loophole, it doesn't require a drivers'
license! To people like me, a multiple flunker of the roadtest, a micro-car is
just the thing. I know how to drive, I do, I do, I do. I just get all flustered
when I have to prove it under the stern, judgmental eyes of the state. 27 miles
per hour is just about right for me.
       Of course, tootling about in my light little micro-car, rather like
Stuart Little in his roadster, I would be no match for the sports utility
vehicles that roam I-95 like woolly mammoths looking for prey. I hate those
cars--why should anything be bigger than it has to be? Perennial cry of one who
was always the shortest girl in the class, I know. So I would only use it on
back roads, to go to tag sales and garden centers on weekends in Connecticut.
Those are just about the only places I want to go, anyway.
       And they ask me why I'm so keen on France!
