            Newspapers lately have been filled with reports of
widespread corruption in the Los Angeles Police Department. The
New York Times called it the LAPD's worst
corruption scandal in  60 years. What is the gist of the story?

            The scandal began as a limited investigation of two
officers in the LAPD's Rampart Division, which covers eight square miles west
of downtown. Officer David Mack was arrested in late 1997 for robbing a bank of
more than $700,000. A few months later, his former partner, Rafael Perez, stole
8 pounds of cocaine from police evidence lockers. Believing that the two crimes
were connected, investigators began to examine whether other Rampart officers
participated in or knowingly overlooked such misconduct.

            Last week, Perez agreed to cooperate with prosecutors
in exchange for a lighter sentence. Since then, he has accused several officers
of dealing drugs, making wrongful arrests, planting evidence, and abusing
suspects. He contends that such abuses of power are common--and largely
ignored--in the specialized anti-gang and anti-drug units of the Rampart
Division. 

            Twelve officers have been suspended so far. Perez's
revelations have also forced the department to revisit hundreds of cases that
may have relied on false testimony or evidence. One inmate was released after
Perez admitted that he and his partner shot the man and then planted a gun on
him so they could claim self-defense. Investigators are now examining at least
one other shooting--this one fatal--that Perez has called "dirty." The LAPD
could face multi-million-dollar lawsuits from victims of wrongdoing.

            No one has established any direct connections among the
various crimes yet. But federal officials are planning to investigate whether
the alleged misdeeds are "pattern and practice" on the force.
