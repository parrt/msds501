            Andrew--So, given your commitment to lots of medical care, am I right to
assume that you oppose cuts in the British health care budget? Maybe if the
system wasn't so cheap your dentist would have sprung for some Novocaine.

            I wasn't defending small health-care expenditures. I'm all in favor of
everyone getting everything they need . I was making a point about health and
health care as related to other social values. For instance, awful as your
childhood dental experience was, at least you had a dentist! In this country,
lots of people can't afford any kind of dental care (it mostly isn't covered by
Medicaid) and are just out of luck.

            What's the situation with people who are HIV positive and don't have private
health insurance that pays for the drug regimen? I think I remember a news
story which said they were getting too expensive for Medicaid. And the 40
million people who have neither private insurance nor Medicaid--what happens to
them?

            Talk to you soon,
Katha

            PS. I love Japanese food. Better a thousand nights of sushi than a single
meal of baked beans on toast. Your portrait of Japan is funny, but if they were
really as timid and mingy as you suggest, they wouldn't be so healthy and
long-lived. (Unlike the British, who I think are not so healthy in general.)
We're always reading about Japan's weird side--the businessmen reading
sado-porn comics on the morning train, and schoolgirls moonlighting as
prostitutes, people eating potentially fatal blowfish just for kicks. And, of
course, the incredible level of sexism, conformity, pollution, hideous modern
buildings and so on. I'll bet their newspapers carry the same sort of stories
about us.
