            The New York thing is easy: It wasn't to my taste, but New Yorkers tended to
like it the way it was. Like Egypt holding a Christian New Year celebration at
the pyramids, New York under Giuliani is playing to the tourists. That may be
good strategy for an economy losing manufacturing jobs (a strategy honed for
decades by New Orleans), but that's a fickle crowd to keep happy. I say just
give up and put a giant casino in the middle of it. Like New Orleans.

            I'm handling the Peanuts thing so well. Mainly because, as with Capra, I
never saw the dark side, only the Met Life commercials side. Frankly, I cross
people off my list who say It's a Wonderful Life is their favorite
movie.

            The Staples Center scandal is remarkable precisely because, in defense of
the Times ' behavior, so many other egregious examples of
editorial-advertiser coziness surface. I do think it stinks that newspapers own
teams that their sports pages have to "cover," or that even the most
distinguished papers hold conferences, seminars, and festivals that then tend
to get "covered" more than events sponsored by others. It's a practice
indistinguishable except in degree from TV newscasts' doing "stories" that just
"happen" to tie in to the movies that preceded them. Don't get me started.

            Does this Putin guy scare you? Personally, I loved Yeltsin's resignation
speech. The slowest anybody has ever been allowed to speak on television, like
the Russian branch of Bob and Ray's Slow Talkers of America. We're gonna miss
that lovable old drunk. Now comes a guy who actually knows how to run a
government, and thinks the coolest branch thereof is the secret police.
