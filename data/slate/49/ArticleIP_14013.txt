            seeing
her off
only incense greets him
coming back into the room

            
stretched on the floor
after a long day's talking
rubbing noses with his cat

            first
frost whitens grasses,
first white smoke
from his neighbor's cabin

            snow at
night:
deep-sleeping population
comes drifting down

            friend
not seen for years:
gray whiskers
around the boyish smile

            after
the staid snowfalls
the rain now
splashy as children

            on and
on
reading a friend's new novel
wishing to be more kind

            the
great dead mallow
ready for chopping
springs purple flowers

            mind
wandering,
suddenly driving very fast:
Mozart in the car

            
farmers' market
carrying flowers carefully
down crowded aisles

            girls
jump rope
in out pepper pepper
old man wipes his brow

            evening
tea
contemplating the great kindness
of everyone

            before
they risk a word
the poets at the lily pond
drink three cups of wine

            awkward
moment:
gazing into each other's eyes
a bit too long

            
summer's offering
ants on the windowsill
ants in the cat's dish

            on
Hendry's Beach
respectable, leashed dog, sniffed
by free-ranging others

            
collecting beach stones
holes and odd edges:
slow artistry

            
house-mice scurry
awake from their naps
after the heat of the day

            digging
out the dandelions;
readying ground
for the next generation

            
throw-aways at the curb:
inside-out umbrella
bed that wouldn't work

            the
poppies sway
the wind looks around
the cat licks herself

            awake,
listening:
laughter of guest love-makers
trying to be more quiet

            cooling
evening breeze:
the potted plants take water
yield back earth-scent

            late
for work
he stands there reading
an old love letter

            patch of moonlight
rocking, rocking,
won't come in with the tide
