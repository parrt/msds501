            With the millennium
looming, the list-makers seem to have inherited the earth. First, the American
Film Institute drew up a register of the 100 greatest American
films ever made. Random House's Modern Library chased the idea a few
months later with its own list of the 100 best works of fiction of the century, and next month it
promises to name the 100 best works of nonfiction . Last month, the Freedom Forum's
Newseum compiled a roster of the 100 top stories of the century , and this week New York
University's journalism department pegged the century's 100 best works of American journalism .

            Not to be left behind, we've plundered the
extensive newspaper archives at the Columbia University School of Journalism,
our Nexis account, and even Peter Jennings' new best-selling book to assemble a
more compelling--and concise--look at the 100 high points of the century.

            Your mileage may vary, so if you've come across an
important headline that we've overlooked, please send it to 100TopHeds@slate.com.
