        10; Tel. 91/420 23 18; fax 91/420 05 59. The price may look a little
        steep, until you realize that all the brightly decorated rooms are

        comfortable salons for the price of a standard three- or four-star
        room. Its just minutes from the Pla­za Mayor and the Prado. Small and
        in demand, so make reservations several weeks in advance. Wheelchair

        This huge high-rise right on the Plaza de España is all sheen and
        international sophistication, but is not as elegant as one might think.
