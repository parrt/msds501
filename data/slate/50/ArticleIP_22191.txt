            A year ago I was living in
a $150,000 apartment, which I owned. It was a small, two-room apartment. Now I
am living in a $175,000 apartment, which I own. It is also a small two-room
apartment. In fact, it is the same apartment, although a little shabbier. A
year ago I could have sold the apartment for $150,000. Now I can sell it for
$175,000.

            Am I richer? I would
have $25,000 more in cash if I sold today vs. a year ago. But money is a
sterile thing, good only for what it will buy. Today's $175,000 will buy 62,724
packages of Product 19, whereas last year's $150,000 would have bought only
53,763 packages, so I am richer in Product 19. I do not, however, live on
Product 19 alone.

            We are accustomed to the idea that we should convert all
dollar amounts to "real" values by adjusting with the consumer price index.
Because the CPI rose by 1.7 percent in the past year (January to January), the
value of my apartment rose by only 14.7 percent in terms of the goods and
services included in the CPI, rather than the 16.6 percent by which it rose in
terms of dollars.

            But if I sell my
apartment, I probably won't use the proceeds to buy that month's assortment of
stuff that's in the CPI. I will probably want to buy some other asset that will
yield a stream of income into the future. I could, for example, buy 30-year
Treasury bonds. In March 1998 the $150,000 from my apartment sale would have
bought bonds with a total yield of $8,925 a year. In March 1999 with $175,000 I
can buy such bonds with a yield of $9,730 a year. In those terms I have got
richer.

            But Treasury bonds are not what make everyone feel richer
every day. I might want to be more venturesome in the hope of getting a
larger--though riskier--income stream. Suppose I buy shares in the S&P 500
Index. The price of that index rose 21.3 percent in the past year (to March
11). Since the price of my apartment rose by only 16.6 percent, I can buy only
96.1 percent as much of the S&P 500 as I could have bought a year ago. But
what I care about is how much future income I will get. If the future income
from the stocks in the S&P 500 has risen by 4 percent per share, I would be
getting as much future income from buying in 1999 as I would have got from
buying in 1998. But I really don't know whether it has risen that much. So, I
don't know whether the shares of the S&P 500 I can buy for $175,000 in
March 1999 are worth more than the shares I could have bought in March
1998.

            In March 1998 I could
have bought 1,859 shares of Microsoft for the $150,000 price of my apartment.
In March 1999 I can buy 1,084 shares. Am I richer or poorer in terms of the
opportunity to earn income from Microsoft? Possibly the probable income from
the 1,084 shares is greater than the probable income from the 1,859 shares was.
But I don't know.

            So am I richer than I was? The rise in the price tag of my
apartment, combined with the changes in prices of other things, changes the
opportunities I face. I have an opportunity to get more cash, more Product 19,
and more annual income from Treasury bonds. In those terms I have become
richer. In terms of opportunity to enjoy living in my apartment, I am neither
richer nor poorer. I have become poorer in terms of my opportunity to buy the
S&P 500 and even poorer in terms of my opportunity to buy Microsoft.
Whether I have become richer or poorer in opportunity to earn income from the
S&P 500 or from Microsoft I don't know, and neither does anyone else.

            I suppose we do know
something about who has got richer or poorer relative to others in the past two
years. The person who owned shares in Microsoft has got richer relative to the
person who owned the S&P 500, and that person has got richer relative to
me, and I have got richer relative to the people who produced the stuff that
went into the CPI, and they have got richer relative to the people who had
cash. I guess I am richer relative to the poor fellow who wants to earn the
cost of my apartment by writing essays for $1 a word.

            The wealth of the nation is its future stream of national
income. That stream is almost certainly a rising one. Year by year, and little
by little, we are as a nation--taking us all together--getting richer. But that
has little to do with, and is much less than, the surge in asset prices in the
past two years. Wealth is not wealth that alters when Greenspan speaks.

            And yet, and yet, despite these uncertainties I
feel richer when the price tag on the apartment I live in goes up. That may be
an illusion, but illusions are facts of life.
