To make dinner, I open a cookbook, acquire some raw ingredients, then execute one or more recipes, usually in a specific sequence.\n",

This incoming data is analogous to a recipe's list of ingredients and is specified in the form of one or more named *parameters* (also called *arguments*).

    "\n",
    "The problem is that, now, `sum` only works on that global data. It's not generically useful. The clue is that the function ignores the `data` argument. So, technically the function can see global data, but it's not a good idea. (Violating this rule to alter a global variable is also a good way to get a subtle bug that's difficult to find.)"
