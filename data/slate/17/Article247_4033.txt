            Dear Todd:

            Thanks so much for the compliments. Although since I was only one of many
people involved with the Letterman show, God only knows whose jokes you were
repeating.

            Well, I guess this it. Our last e-mail. Which makes me a little sad, but I
guess my sadness will be offset by the celebration being thrown by our
hate-mail buddies. And their feelings matter, too. To someone. Even if not to
me or you.

            I was holding off buying your Gary Coleman gift after reading in USA
Today that Drew Barrymore's estranged mother, Jaid, also has a Web site on
which she is auctioning off several collections of Drew's baby clothes
(including an undershirt decorated with baby chicks ). OK, yes, this seems like
a shockingly lowbrow, sociopathically self-serving, egomaniacal betrayal and
perversion of the mother-daughter bond until after you hear how touchingly Jaid
explains it: "Drew is such a special amazing magical person" she says," that I
decided to put some of her things up on the Web site to allow people to be a
part of her life." And you know, if there is a better way to become a part of
the life of a complete stranger than to own their baby clothing, it can only be
to own their spatula. So I think I have made my gift decision. Todd, go buy
yourself some eggs and sit by the mailbox. Better cooking is on it's way.

            This has been a lot of fun. Thanks.
