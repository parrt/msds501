            To start with an image of
the tragic,what would have beenthis poem's end--if this morningI hadn't eaten a
roll with jam I might havesaid, finally, the nightdid what night always does,
it swallowedmy two friends, their arms slung around each other's waists,after I
drove off chasing my highbeams.Outside their shingled walls & roof
earlierand surrounded by pinewoodsthat evening my friends & I had been
saying goodbyewhen one of them--the man--surprised by the baby-seat suddenly
visiblein the back of the car (lit up by an interior lightas I opened the
door)--he said, my friend said Jeez, they (meaning Michaela & our daughter
Simone),they won't be able to go anywhere.Seeing I was as far as 150 miles from
homewith the car, & my beinga potential traffic fatality,or worse (deadbeat
dad, abandoner), he was right.I saw myself a moment as indispensable, happy to
be needed, much likea canoe-paddling guide or gondola pilot.But my other
friend--the woman--squinting at the baby-seatwith pity & amusement, she
saidFor christ's sake, you might as well wear a chastity belt.And somehowthe
mention of sex dragged death behind it--I meannow that I have settled(with
responsibilities)my dates with this or that sexual tsunami should bea thing of
the past,right?So there I was--caught between being one man or another,
neither.Really, none of this is tragic.Can I be loved enough, that's my
story.
