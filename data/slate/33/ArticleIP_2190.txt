            Well, for a while we thought
we'd try to be the only organization in either the software or the magazine
business not to be peddling T-shirts on the side. But Slate's technical-support department (three
chimpanzees and a demoted Microsoft program manager) reports that among the
most frequently asked questions is this one: "What am I supposed to wear while
reading an online magazine?" We naturally consulted our monthly "Clothes
Sense" columnist, Anne Hollander, who advised that traditional
geekwear--boxer shorts, T-shirt, and baseball cap--is appropriate for both
sexes and any hour of the day.

            We're still working on the
boxer shorts, but the T-shirt and cap are now available. Scientific studies
indicate that they enhance the pleasure of reading Slate by anywhere from 19
percent to 26 percent. They are also suitable for puttering in the garden, plea
bargaining on both the federal and state levels, or writing fiction or poetry
(blank verse only, please--Slate cannot be held responsible for rhymes).

            The cost is $14.95 for the
T-shirt and $11.95 for the cap. To order (toll-free, 24 hours a day, seven days
a week), dial 800-380-3180 (United States only). Or order directly off the
Web.
(This links you to the order form for all Microsoft logo products, and you have
to scroll down a bit to find the Slate stuff. Ask for item no. MS0306SL
[T-shirt] or MS0403SL [cap].) When we checked a few days ago, the Slate
products were illustrated with a pile of golf balls. If that's still the case,
just ignore it.
