            Stylish New Yorkers have for
years mocked D.C. for its indifference to fashion. This week is our revenge: a
city obsessed with a dress. (A fashion question: Why would Monica wear a
cocktail dress to work ? Is that what was meant when they said she
dressed inappropriately? She confused an evening out with a busy day at the
office?)

            When I
turned on the television Sunday morning I saw, in huge white letters on a black
background, "The DRESS." Sadly, it turned out to be a Tylenol ad about a bride
and her wedding dress.

            Of all the salacious, disgusting, far-fetched notions I
have heard about the dress, my 
                  Slate
                colleague Emily Yoffe has
the most absurd: the Cinematic Dress. This is a three-stage excuse for Clinton,
based on the plot of recent movies.

            Stage 1: Primary
Colors . Clinton denies that the stain is his semen. Then, as the Clintonian
character did in Primary Colors , he switches the blood sample. A loyal
aide like Bruce Lindsey would take a bullet for him. Surely he would take a
pinprick.

            Stage 2:
If that fails, Presumed Innocent , a movie in which the hero is accused
of murder when his wife saves his semen and spreads it on a woman she murders.
Clinton might claim that Hillary surreptitiously collected his semen and
smeared it on the dress.

            
When that fails, Stage 3: There's Something
About Mary . This I can't bear to explain.

            A final note. The
circumlocution about the semen-stained dress has been incredible. The
New York Times has managed to work up the courage to use "semen," and I
heard Newsweek 's Mike Isikoff say the word on television (though not
without a noticeable gulp). Most other media have resorted to "DNA-stained" or
"stained with genetic material"--phrases that are magnificently vague.
