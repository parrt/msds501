        Below is a selection of accommodations in towns and villages
        throughout the Lake District. It is always advisable to make
        reservations well in advance, particularly if you will be visiting in
        high season (late June–mid Sept) or during school holidays (one week in
        late May and one week in late Oct).
        Almost all rooms in the Lake District are priced at a
        B&B (bed-and-breakfast) rate, per person, with a fee added at many
        places for individuals traveling alone. Many Lakeland hotels also quote
        a D, B&B (dinner, bed, and breakfast) rate, which includes the
        evening meal and is often quite cost-effective.
        If you arrive in the Lake District without a reservation,
        contact one of the information offices of the British Tourist Authority
        for lists of lodgings and assistance in booking (see Accommodations,
        page 108, and Tourist Information Offices, page 125).
        If you wish to make a booking before you arrive in the UK,
        dial 00 44 and then the number of the establishment you require.
        Remember to use the area code in parentheses beside the telephone
        number.
