            Writing about the
mysteriesyou can't quite say what they were.Sacrifices? fasting? walking
belowor sprinkling drops of water nearthe marriage bed where the celebrants
laybriefly with the sacred one beforethe raising up of objects?You, the writer
separated from herby centuries, know only that later she'llreappear sometimes
on vases ...Hell was invented about this time;later sources aren't
reliable.

            Aristotle writes that
you'll sufferover the mysteries but will learnnothing new. The past slips into
you finally.Generations kept these secrets.Islands fell asleep looking at the
sea.The one who ruled you above will rule youbelow, taking you down to show you
the cut part of the wheat.Probably she was earth, your hunger was beautiful,her
hunger was beautiful,but what do you really know?

            Much was enacted, much was
shown,the burning one is soughtas an emblem; just once you will lie downbetween
her legs. The ritualgoes on with its potions,its implied promises; the priest
goes onwith his combs, his animals,the exhausted wheat held up--you try in
vain, and after your researchamong the transcripts of the institutionwhat gives
you immortal life turns out to be the breath of another person ...

            Belief in
the subterranean roomshas haunted you. Not finding themisn't it the same as if
you had?We know you through your writingsand your complaints. Of courseshe
found you, though you believedshe loved you less than she should have--your
short smile, your long tears,your fingers exiting the page,the chords of your
mysteriesabsolute and wild and brief--
