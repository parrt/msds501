new depths in Monica Lewinsky

            a friend reports that a
lawyer here in town who is helping William Ginsburg, auctioned off a dinner at
his house at one of the local girls' schools (Cathedral i think) recently. To
the surprise of the buyers, present at the small gathering was no other than
Monica herself. She was, they reported, not only luscious but charming and
witty. Soon we can expect a raft of such reports in which Monica will slowly be
revealed as a renaissance woman, whose deep knowledge of American poetry is
matched only by her understanding of the historical tensions underlying the
current insurrections in Kosovo (she worries especially about the Bulgarian
connection tho doubts that Kosovo's natives are in fact the heirs of
Alexander).

            Funny you should mention
Monica Lewinsky. I ran into her last night at the Mayflower Hotel where she was
having cocktails with several middle-aged men in double breasted suits. She is
as perky and precocious as Bill Safire and Cokie Roberts say. When I spoke with
her, she apologized for her slightly glazed eyes, having spent the last
forty-eight hours teaching herself ancient Greek. With all this time on her
hands, she has decided to read Homer in the original. She also said she was at
work on a translation of Vico. We engaged in a perfectly delightful
conversation about the Pentagon's two-war strategy. The descriptions of her in
the press as "competent" hardly do her justice.

            monica's in my painting
class. she's an amazing talent. perhaps a tad derivative of golub, but still an
artist of far more restraint and maturity than one might expect of someone her
age.

            all the more remarkable
since she suffers, of course, from dyslexia (hence her failure on the writing
test at one of those firms jordan sent her to). I understand she's been invited
by Sally Quinn to speak at that school for challenged kids in Georgetown.

            What's truly astounding is
that I saw an application of hers for a job here at MS. She was applying for a
development position with the Windows 99 team. Her resume said she could
program c, c++, Java, DHTML, VSS, BSS, and STD. She claims STD was one of the
easier ones to acquire!

            It's funny that you guys
should be talking about this today because I happened to run into Monica at the
Washington Wizards-Denver Nuggets game last night. She gave me a 15-minute
disquisition on the NBA's illegal defense rule: I've never heard it explained
so carefully. Turns out she's a big basketball fan too--she played a little for
Lewis & Clark (shooting guard, natch), and was even drafted by the WNBA. (I
guess that explains where she got those kneepads.)

            OK, get back to work and
stop picking on this sweet young woman. You're all being sexist. If a man had
done what she did, no one would ... wait a minute, that's not right. Well,
never mind, just get back to work.
