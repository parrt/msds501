Wrap-Up
            

            Today's question garnered far
more responses than any before. Rather than ruin their poetical rhythms, all

"playing"--rich comic territory. And perhaps there is a rich vein of Bush
loathing waiting to be mined. But there are other possibilities:

            Defeat of Al D'Amato means
IRS less likely to audit returns of particularly vituperative players.

            Enormous population of
nonvoters felt time was better spent making crude remarks at expense of fatuous
candidates.

            Deliberately misleading "cash
prizes" rumor now circulating freely.

            We leaked the pseudonym
Salinger uses when he plays the quiz.

            Participants still giddy from
Halloween sugar high.

            "Tennis, or
even backgammon."

            The final
piece in the Bushes as New Political Dynasty puzzle--the loser brother. Their
Billy Carter? Neil Bush, a director of Silverado Banking, a savings and loan
whose failure cost the taxpayers $1 billion.

the Dead and Assigning the Blame Extra
            

            "People were very angry
last night. Today it's a mixture of seething and dismay. It's just
ugly."--anonymous GOP aide , explaining who's responsible for yesterday's
disappointing results: Newt Gingrich

            "Most people are really
angry with Newt, and no one knows what to do with it."--some other anonymous
GOP aide , determining who caused this election debacle: Newt Gingrich

            "There's no way to put a
smiley face on it."--James Dobson of Focus on the Family, laying the
blame at the door of that foul-up Newt Gingrich

            "He looks like the victim
of an accident. He's very somber in tone."--Rep. Peter King , describing
how a guy looks when he's derailed a major political party: a guy like Newt
Gingrich

            "I frankly don't
understand all the things that happened yesterday, and I'm not sure anybody
else in the country does either."--Newt Gingrich , deciding it's not
really his fault after all
