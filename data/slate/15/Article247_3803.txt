            Dear Ted:

            Screw the Times , young readers, and everything else for the moment.
Let's start with: The test ban is good. It's better than no test ban. And yes,
it's imperfect. And no, we won't be able to know everything everyone does in
the world. But knowing a lot of it and being able to nail a government for
testing is better than "who cares." Fact is, we're moving away from arms
control. The real threat comes from Russia, still. They have lots of plutonium
and the people there are eating their cats. Someone, somewhere is converting
those bombs into ready cash. We need an all-out program to buy this stuff up.
Clinton is proposing something like that, but it needs to be the big
front-burner story for the world. Or are we counting on nuclear winter to
counteract global warming, producing mild temperatures along the Eastern
Seaboard?

             Also, wouldn't Jesse Helms and Trent Lott and pals
love to see the door open to testing for all kinds of Star Wars shit?
Call me a dopey idealist, but I think there are still too many people who go
sick, hungry, and uneducated right here to be playing with these toys.

            How about the French union leader who is being celebrated by the press there
for bombing a McDonald's? Did somebody say globalization? Did he do it because
McDonald's is such a great repressive corporate octopus or it's just that they
wouldn't make him a pâté burger?

            Yum,
Steve
