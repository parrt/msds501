            Katha,
Did you write that pre-caffeine?

            I never said or even implied you didn't support equal marriage rights. I
merely protested that it is simply wrong to conflate the cultural arguments for
marriage rights with the political ones. Which seems to me to be the point
you're making in your response. So we agree. But in your previous posting - and
in your piece in my marriage anthology - it is you who equated married life
with certain "conservative" impulses, and (gently) warned homosexuals not to
idealize it. You can't have it both ways.

            But you're right, of course, that marriage can be interpreted and lived a
zillion different ways; that many people in non-marital bliss can be more
conservative in their way of life than some with church white weddings. But
you're exaggerating surely when you say that the left has completely acceded to
"family values". The Democrats have, but the Left? In lower Manhattan? All your
friends at the Nation ? Come off it.

            Speaking of the Left, I'm glad that NOW has clarified itself today on the
Paula Jones case. NOW is a liberal interest group designed to advance liberal
policies with regard to women (if abortion on demand can be described as
liberal) and consistently has no truck with abused or harrassed women who might
in other circumstances hold conservative views. Both right and left in
Washington are like this, of course. (I'm not saying that NOW is worse in the
hypocrisy game than, say, the Christian Coalition which, bizarrely, supports
Jones). The ends for all these organizations always justify the means. How else
to explain the discrepancies between NOW's positions on Clarence Thomas, Bob
Packwood, and Bill Clinton? But NOW at least has the good grace to admit it,
and to get on with the nasty game of political warfare.

            bye for now
Andrew
